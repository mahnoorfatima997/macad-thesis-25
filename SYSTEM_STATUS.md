# MEGA Cognitive Benchmarking System Status

## âœ… System Ready for Testing

### Component Status

1. **MENTOR Environment** âœ…
   - Multi-agent system installed and available
   - LangGraph orchestrator configured
   - 5 specialized agents ready:
     - Analysis Agent
     - Socratic Tutor Agent
     - Domain Expert Agent
     - Cognitive Enhancement Agent
     - Context Agent
   - Knowledge base (ChromaDB) initialized

2. **Generic AI Environment** âœ…
   - OpenAI API configured
   - Direct assistance mode ready
   - Fallback responses available if API fails

3. **Control Environment** âœ…
   - No AI assistance baseline ready
   - Self-directed design workspace configured

4. **Linkography System** âœ…
   - Real-time design move tracking
   - Cognitive pattern analysis
   - Metrics calculation

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **ChromaDB Collection Exists Warning**
   - This is normal when the knowledge base has been initialized before
   - Does not affect functionality
   - The system will use the existing collection

2. **Unicode Encoding in Console**
   - Windows console may show encoding errors for emojis
   - Does not affect the Streamlit web interface
   - All functionality works correctly in the dashboard

### How to Run

```bash
# Full system with all three test conditions
python launch_full_test.py

# Or if you only need Generic AI and Control
python launch_minimal_test.py
```

### Research Configuration

The system is configured to compare:
1. **MENTOR** - Prevents cognitive offloading through scaffolding
2. **Generic AI** - Enables cognitive offloading with direct answers
3. **Control** - Natural baseline without AI assistance

All interactions are tracked with:
- Real-time linkography analysis
- 6 cognitive metrics (COP, DTE, SE, KI, LP, MA)
- Complete session logging
- Pre/post test assessments

### Data Output

Session data saved to:
- `thesis_tests/test_data/` - Session logs
- `thesis_tests/linkography_data/` - Linkography analysis
- `thesis_tests/uploads/` - User artifacts
