# Testing Framework and Comparative Analysis Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document presents the comprehensive testing framework designed to evaluate three distinct approaches to architectural design assistance: **MENTOR** (experimental multi-agent scaffolding), **Generic AI** (direct AI assistance), and **Control** (no AI assistance). The framework implements a rigorous three-group experimental design with validated assessment tools, real-time cognitive metrics, and advanced statistical analysis methods to measure learning effectiveness and cognitive development in architectural design education.

## 1. Research Design Overview

### 1.1 Experimental Framework

The testing framework implements a **between-subjects experimental design** comparing three distinct learning environments:

- **Independent Variable**: Type of design assistance (MENTOR vs Generic AI vs Control)
- **Dependent Variables**: Cognitive metrics, learning progression, design quality
- **Control Variables**: Design brief, time allocation, assessment criteria
- **Sample Size**: Designed for 30+ participants per group (N=90+)

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. **Primary**: Does Socratic scaffolding through multi-agent systems improve cognitive development compared to direct AI assistance?
2. **Secondary**: How do different AI assistance approaches affect cognitive offloading, deep thinking engagement, and metacognitive awareness?
3. **Tertiary**: What patterns of design thinking emerge across different support environments?

### 1.3 Theoretical Foundation

The framework builds on established educational and cognitive theories:

- **Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development**: Scaffolding effectiveness measurement
- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Cognitive operation classification
- **Linkography Theory** (Goldschmidt, 1990): Design thinking pattern analysis
- **ICAP Framework** (Chi et al., 2001): Interactive learning engagement levels
