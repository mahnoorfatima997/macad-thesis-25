## Quick Start Guide

### For General Audiences
Start with **01_system_architecture.md** for a high-level overview, then explore the visual diagrams to understand system components.

### For Educators
Focus on **02_cognitive_metrics_explained.md** to understand the educational theory and assessment methods.

### For Researchers
Review **04_testing_framework_methodology.md** for experimental design and **02_cognitive_metrics_explained.md** for scientific foundations.

### For Technical Teams
Study **03_data_flow_visualization.md** for implementation details and **technical_details.html** for formulas and calculations.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Cognitive Metrics
- **COP**: Cognitive Offloading Prevention - Prevents dependency on AI for answers
- **DTE**: Deep Thinking Engagement - Promotes analytical reasoning
- **SE**: Scaffolding Effectiveness - Adaptive learning support
- **KI**: Knowledge Integration - Multi-source synthesis
- **LP**: Learning Progression - Skill development tracking
- **MA**: Metacognitive Awareness - Self-reflection development

### System Components
- **Multi-Agent System**: 5 specialized agents (Socratic, Domain Expert, Cognitive Enhancement, Analysis, Context)
- **RAG System**: Knowledge retrieval from architectural documents
- **Linkography Engine**: Real-time design process analysis
- **Graph ML Pipeline**: Pattern recognition and clustering
- **Benchmarking Dashboard**: Comprehensive visualization and analysis

### Testing Groups
1. **MENTOR Group**: Uses full multi-agent system with Socratic questioning
2. **Generic AI Group**: Direct AI assistance (ChatGPT-like)
3. **Control Group**: No AI assistance, static resources only
