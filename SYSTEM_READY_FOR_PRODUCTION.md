## üì± User Experience Features

### Response Types Working Correctly

#### ‚úÖ **Knowledge Only Responses**
```
Passive cooling strategies include natural ventilation, thermal mass, and shading. 
These techniques reduce energy consumption by using environmental conditions.
```

#### ‚úÖ **Balanced Guidance Responses**
```
Synthesis:

- Insight: Hot climate community centers require careful attention to passive cooling...
- Watch: Don't simply copy solutions - adapt principles to your specific climate...
- Direction: Start by analyzing your site's wind patterns, sun angles, and local materials...
```

#### ‚úÖ **Socratic Clarification Responses**
```
Let me help clarify spatial hierarchy. Think about how you move through a building - 
what spaces feel most important? What draws your attention first?
```

#### ‚úÖ **Gamified Responses**
```
üåü Excellent question! You're thinking like a true architect by considering 
material choices early in the design process.
```
