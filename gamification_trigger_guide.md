# üéÆ Gamification Trigger Guide for mentor.py

This guide provides specific user inputs that will trigger each gamification game in mentor.py conversations. Use these examples to test the interactive games during actual design conversations.

## üéØ How Gamification is Triggered

The gamification system is triggered based on:
1. **User intent detection** - Specific keywords and phrases in user messages
2. **Conversation context** - Current design phase and discussion topics  
3. **Cognitive enhancement needs** - When the system detects opportunities for deeper thinking
4. **Challenge type mapping** - Different inputs map to different game types

## üéÆ Testing Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Start conversations naturally** - Don't just paste trigger phrases
2. **Provide context** - Mention your building type and design challenges
3. **Be specific** - The more detailed your problem, the better the game response
4. **Engage fully** - Complete the games for the best learning experience

### Example Conversation Flow:
```
User: "I'm designing a community center for a diverse neighborhood. I'm struggling with the main entrance - people seem to avoid it and use the side doors instead. I can't figure out why this is happening."

[This would trigger the Mystery Investigation Game]
```

### Building Types That Work Well:
- Community centers
- Libraries  
- Schools
- Museums
- Hospitals
- Office buildings
