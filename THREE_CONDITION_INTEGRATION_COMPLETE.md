# **THREE-CONDITION TESTING INTEGRATION - COMPLETE**
## **‚úÖ MAJOR UI/UX UPDATES & TASK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

The three-condition testing framework has been successfully integrated into the existing mentor.py system with major UI/UX improvements and comprehensive task implementation from the test logic documents.

---

## **üéØ MAJOR UI/UX CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Test Mode is Now Primary Focus**
```bash
streamlit run mentor.py
```
**The dashboard now opens with test mode as the primary interface!**

### **2. Restructured Sidebar**
- **üî¨ Research Test Dashboard** is the main header
- **Test Group Assignment** is the primary selection (replaces "Mentor Type")
- **Test Condition Options**:
  - **Socratic Agent** - Multi-agent scaffolding system
  - **Raw GPT** - Direct AI assistance
  - **No AI** - Self-directed design work
- **System Configuration** moved to secondary section
- **Advanced Gamification button REMOVED**
- **Skill Level selector REMOVED** (fixed to "Intermediate" for research consistency)

### **3. Prominent Design Task Display**
The main interface now prominently displays:

**üèóÔ∏è Design Challenge**
> **You are tasked with designing a community center for a diverse urban neighborhood of 15,000 residents.**
>
> **Site**: Former industrial warehouse (150m x 80m x 12m height)
>
> **Key Considerations**:
> - Community needs assessment and cultural sensitivity
> - Sustainability and adaptive reuse principles
> - Flexible programming for diverse activities
> - Integration with existing urban fabric

### **4. Phase-Specific Subtasks**
Dynamic subtasks appear based on current phase:

**Ideation Phase**:
- What questions should we ask about this community?
- How can the existing industrial character be preserved and enhanced?
- What successful warehouse-to-community transformations can inform your approach?

**Visualization Phase**:
- Create diagrams showing circulation patterns and adjacency requirements
- Sketch key spatial relationships and community interaction zones
- Visualize how the existing structure integrates with new program elements

**Materialization Phase**:
- Specify materials and construction methods that support your design vision
- Detail how new systems integrate with preserved industrial elements
- Address structural modifications within the existing grid system

## **üî¨ THREE TEST CONDITIONS WITH ENHANCED TASK IMPLEMENTATION**

### **MENTOR Test (Group A) - Enhanced Socratic Scaffolding**
- **Base**: Full multi-agent system with enhanced phase-specific interactions
- **Ideation Enhancements** (from test logic documents):
  - "Before we begin designing, what do you think are the most important questions we should ask about this community?"
  - "What are some successful examples of warehouse-to-community transformations you're aware of?"
  - "Why might the existing industrial character be valuable to preserve? What would be lost if we completely transformed it?"
  - "How are you approaching this problem differently than a typical new-build community center?"

- **Visualization Enhancements**:
  - "How might you visualize these spatial relationships? Consider sketching your concepts."
  - "What does this proportion suggest about your intended community capacity?"
  - "How do your spatial relationships reflect community interaction patterns?"
  - "How can you represent the integration between existing industrial elements and new community functions?"

- **Materialization Enhancements**:
  - "What materials and construction methods would support your design vision while respecting the existing structure?"
  - "How do your design modifications work with the existing structural grid?"
  - "What construction sequencing would allow the community center to remain partially operational during renovation?"

### **Generic AI Test (Group B) - Comprehensive Direct Assistance**
- **Base**: Direct AI assistance with detailed phase-specific information
- **Ideation Information**: Programming analysis, community demographics, adaptive reuse strategies, site integration
- **Visualization Information**: Spatial diagrams, technical drawings, design communication methods
- **Materialization Information**: Structural systems, building envelope, MEP systems, construction approaches
- **Behavior**: Provides comprehensive information without scaffolding questions

### **Control Test (Group C) - Self-Directed with Minimal Prompts**
- **Base**: Minimal AI assistance with phase-appropriate self-direction
- **Ideation**: "Continue developing your community center concept. Document your thinking process and design decisions as you work through the challenge."
- **Visualization**: "Proceed with visualizing your design concept. Use sketches, diagrams, or written descriptions to develop your spatial ideas."
- **Materialization**: "Work on the technical implementation of your design. Consider materials, structural systems, and construction methods that support your concept."
