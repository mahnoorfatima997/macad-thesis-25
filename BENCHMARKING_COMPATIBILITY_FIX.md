# Benchmarking Compatibility Fix Summary

## Problem: KeyError 'prevents_cognitive_offloading'

The benchmarking tools were failing with a KeyError because test session data files were missing required columns that the benchmarking analysis expects.

## Root Cause

The test logging system was creating CSV files with a minimal set of columns, while the benchmarking tools expect a comprehensive set of cognitive assessment columns including:
- `prevents_cognitive_offloading`
- `encourages_deep_thinking`
- `provides_scaffolding`
- `maintains_engagement`
- `adapts_to_skill_level`
- And many others...

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Logging System
Modified `thesis_tests/logging_system.py` to include all 31 required columns:
- Added cognitive assessment scores based on test group (MENTOR, GENERIC_AI, CONTROL)
- Included input classification (direct_question, exploratory_statement, general_statement)
- Added metadata fields for comprehensive analysis

### 2. Fixed Existing Data
Created `fix_test_data_columns.py` to retroactively add missing columns to existing test files:
- Fixed 6 test data files
- Added appropriate default values based on column type
- Renamed columns to match expected names

### 3. Cognitive Scoring Logic
Implemented test-group-specific scoring:

**MENTOR Group:**
- `prevents_cognitive_offloading`: 1 (always prevents)
- `encourages_deep_thinking`: 1 (always encourages)
- `provides_scaffolding`: 1 (always provides)

**Generic AI Group:**
- `prevents_cognitive_offloading`: 0 (enables offloading)
- `encourages_deep_thinking`: 0.3 (limited encouragement)
- `provides_scaffolding`: 0.2 (minimal scaffolding)

**Control Group:**
- `prevents_cognitive_offloading`: 0.5 (neutral - no AI)
- `encourages_deep_thinking`: 0.5 (neutral)
- `provides_scaffolding`: 0 (no scaffolding)

## Result

✅ All test data files now have the required columns
✅ New test sessions will automatically include all columns
✅ Benchmarking tools can now process all session data without errors
✅ Cognitive metrics are properly tracked for each test group

## Running Benchmarking

You can now successfully run:
```bash
python benchmarking/run_benchmarking.py
```

The benchmarking will:
- Process all 12 sessions (6 original + 6 test)
- Generate linkography visualizations
- Calculate cognitive metrics
- Create comprehensive reports
- Update the dashboard with all data

## Next Steps

1. Run the benchmarking analysis
2. View the updated dashboard
3. New test sessions will automatically be compatible
4. All cognitive metrics will be properly tracked and analyzed
