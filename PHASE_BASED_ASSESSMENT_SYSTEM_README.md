## Phase-Based Assessment System Design

### Core Philosophy

The new system will implement a **Structured Socratic Assessment Framework** that:

1. **Guides users through specific phase requirements** using predetermined Socratic dialogue patterns
2. **Internally grades responses** against phase-specific criteria
3. **Automatically determines phase completion** and progression
4. **Provides comprehensive feedback** on strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
5. **Maintains conversation flow** while ensuring all assessment requirements are met
