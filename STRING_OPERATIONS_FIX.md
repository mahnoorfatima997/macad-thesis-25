# String Operations Fix for Benchmarking

## Problem: TypeError - 'float' is not iterable

The benchmarking code was failing with `TypeError: argument of type 'float' is not iterable` when trying to check if '?' was in `agent_response`. This happened because some cells in the CSV files contained NaN (float) values instead of strings.

## Root Cause

When CSV files have missing or empty values, pandas reads them as NaN (which is a float type). The benchmarking code was attempting string operations (like `.lower()`, `.split()`, `in` checks) on these NaN values without type checking.

## Solution Applied

Added comprehensive type checking throughout `benchmarking/evaluation_metrics.py`:

### 1. Agent Response Checks
```python
# Before:
if '?' in row['agent_response']:

# After:
if pd.notna(row['agent_response']) and isinstance(row['agent_response'], str) and '?' in row['agent_response']:
```

### 2. Student Input Processing
```python
# Before:
input_text = row['student_input'].lower()

# After:
if pd.notna(row['student_input']) and isinstance(row['student_input'], str):
    input_text = row['student_input'].lower()
```

### 3. List Comprehensions
```python
# Before:
[len(q.split()) for q in question_types['student_input']]

# After:
[len(q.split()) for q in question_types['student_input'] if pd.notna(q) and isinstance(q, str)]
```

## Files Modified

- `benchmarking/evaluation_metrics.py` - Added type checking in 8 different locations where string operations were performed on potentially NaN values

## Impact

✅ Benchmarking can now handle CSV files with missing or empty values
✅ No more TypeErrors when processing test data
✅ More robust evaluation metrics calculation
✅ Graceful handling of incomplete data

## Best Practices Applied

1. Always check `pd.notna()` before string operations on DataFrame values
2. Use `isinstance(value, str)` to ensure type safety
3. Provide default values for cases where data is missing
4. Use conditional expressions in list comprehensions to filter out NaN values

The benchmarking analysis should now run smoothly even with incomplete or missing data in the CSV files.
