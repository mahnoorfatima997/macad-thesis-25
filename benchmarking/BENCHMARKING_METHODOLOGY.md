## 1. Core Metrics Overview

### 1.1 Cognitive Offloading Prevention (COP)

**What we measure:** The system's ability to prevent students from offloading cognitive work by seeking direct answers instead of engaging in critical thinking.

**Why it matters:** Cognitive offloading reduces learning effectiveness and prevents deep understanding (Risko & Gilbert, 2016).

**Target:** >70% prevention rate

### 1.2 Deep Thinking Engagement (DTE)

**What we measure:** The frequency and quality of responses that promote reflection, analysis, and critical thinking.

**Why it matters:** Deep processing leads to better retention and transfer of knowledge (Craik & Lockhart, 1972).

**Target:** >60% engagement rate

### 1.3 Scaffolding Effectiveness (SE)

**What we measure:** How well the system provides appropriate cognitive support based on student skill level.

**Why it matters:** Proper scaffolding enables learning in the Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978).

**Target:** >80% appropriate scaffolding

### 1.4 Knowledge Integration (KI)

**What we measure:** The system's ability to connect relevant knowledge sources to student queries.

**Why it matters:** Integrated knowledge promotes conceptual understanding (Bransford et al., 2000).

**Target:** >75% integration rate

### 1.5 Learning Progression (LP)

**What we measure:** Student advancement through skill levels during interactions.

**Why it matters:** Measurable progression indicates effective learning (Pellegrino et al., 2001).

**Target:** Positive trajectory in >50% of sessions

### 1.6 Metacognitive Awareness (MA)

**What we measure:** Development of self-reflection and learning awareness.

**Why it matters:** Metacognition is crucial for independent learning (Flavell, 1979).

**Target:** >40% metacognitive prompts

## 2. Measurement Methodology

### 2.1 Cognitive Offloading Prevention

#### How we measure:
```python
# From evaluation_metrics.py
prevention_rate = data['prevents_cognitive_offloading'].mean()

# Specific indicators:
- Direct answer requests → Socratic response rate
- "Tell me" queries → Guided discovery rate
- Solution seeking → Process exploration rate
```

#### Calculation method:
1. Classify each student input as direct question or exploratory
2. Check if system response provides direct answer or guides thinking
3. Calculate ratio of prevented offloading attempts

### 2.5 Learning Progression

#### How we measure:
```python
# Progression indicators:
