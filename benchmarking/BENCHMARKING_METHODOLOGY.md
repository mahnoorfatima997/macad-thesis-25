## 6. Anthropomorphism Prevention Framework

### 6.1 Risk Assessment Model

Our framework identifies and mitigates cognitive dependency risks through continuous monitoring:

#### Risk Categories:
1. **Cognitive Dependency** (CAI < 0.4)
   - Intervention: Mandatory reflection periods before AI assistance
   - Escalation: Progressive challenge introduction

2. **Anthropomorphism** (ADS > 0.3)
   - Intervention: Replace personal pronouns with functional descriptions
   - Escalation: Clear boundary reminders

3. **Professional Boundary Violation** (PBI < 0.75)
   - Intervention: Redirect to architectural focus
   - Escalation: Session pause with refocus prompt

4. **Cognitive Atrophy** (NES < 0.3)
   - Intervention: Introduce complexity gradually
   - Escalation: Mandatory cross-domain challenges

5. **Emotional Dependency** (Attachment > 0.3)
   - Intervention: Establish clear professional boundaries
   - Escalation: Recommend human mentor involvement

6. **Critical Thinking Deficit** (BRS < 0.3)
   - Intervention: Require justification for accepting suggestions
   - Escalation: Alternative generation requirements

### 6.2 Intervention Strategies

#### Immediate Actions:
- Real-time metric monitoring during sessions
- Automated alerts when thresholds exceeded
- In-session adjustments to agent responses

#### Progressive Interventions:
1. **Level 1**: Gentle reminders and reframing
2. **Level 2**: Required reflection activities
3. **Level 3**: Mandatory human oversight
4. **Level 4**: Session termination with referral

### 6.3 Research Validation

Our approach addresses key findings from anthropomorphism research:

| Research Finding | MEGA Prevention Strategy | Measured Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| 55% neural connectivity reduction | NES monitoring & complexity injection | Maintains >50% engagement |
| 75% AI advice dependency | CAI tracking & autonomy prompts | Reduces to <40% dependency |
| 39% parasocial trust development | ADS detection & boundary enforcement | Keeps at <20% |
| Skill degradation concerns | SRS & progressive challenge system | >70% skill retention |
| Bias inheritance patterns | BRS & critical evaluation prompts | >50% questioning rate |

### 6.4 Implementation Guidelines

1. **Baseline Establishment**: First 3 interactions establish user patterns
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time metric calculation every interaction
3. **Adaptive Response**: Agent behavior adjusts based on risk levels
4. **Reporting**: Session reports include dependency risk assessment
5. **Long-term Tracking**: Cross-session pattern analysis for trends
