## Implementation with Current Log Data

### Immediately Measurable (with existing logs):

   - Analyze question complexity progression

2. **Anthropomorphism Detection Score (ADS)**
   - Parse `student_input` for personal pronouns and emotional language
   - Analyze `input_type` for personal vs. professional queries
   - Monitor conversation drift from architectural topics

3. **Bias Resistance Score (BRS)**
   - Track questioning patterns in `student_input`
   - Monitor `input_type == 'challenge'` or similar
   - Analyze verification-seeking behavior

### Requires Enhanced Logging:

1. **Neural Engagement Score (NES)**
   - Need: Concept mapping and connection tracking
   - Add: Semantic diversity analysis to logs
   - Track: Cross-domain reference counting

2. **Skill Retention Score (SRS)**

## Implementation Code Snippets

```python
# Example: Cognitive Autonomy Index calculation
def calculate_cai(session_data):
    total_inputs = len(session_data)
    autonomous_inputs = session_data[
        (session_data['input_type'].isin(['exploration', 'hypothesis', 'solution'])) &
        (~session_data['student_input'].str.contains('what|how|tell me|explain', case=False))
    ]
    return len(autonomous_inputs) / total_inputs if total_inputs > 0 else 0

# Example: Anthropomorphism Detection
def calculate_ads(session_data):
    anthropomorphic_patterns = [
        r'\byou\b(?!\s+can|\s+should|\s+need)',  # Personal "you" not instructional
        r'thank you|thanks|please',  # Politeness markers
        r'feel|think|believe|want',  # Attribution of mental states
        r'friend|buddy|helper'  # Relationship terms
    ]
    
    anthropomorphic_count = 0
    for pattern in anthropomorphic_patterns:
        anthropomorphic_count += session_data['student_input'].str.contains(
            pattern, case=False, regex=True
        ).sum()
    
    return anthropomorphic_count / len(session_data) if len(session_data) > 0 else 0
```
