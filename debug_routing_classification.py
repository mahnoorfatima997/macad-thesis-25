A big flexible hall for markets, concerts, and community dinners.

Smaller rooms for workshops, meetings, or after-school activities.

A caf√© that kind of "spills" into the main space so it always feels alive.

Maybe even an indoor garden or green wall to balance out the industrial vibe.

The users? Pretty much everyone ‚Äî kids after school, parents meeting friends, seniors looking for a place to socialize. I want spaces where people can bump into each other naturally instead of being in totally separate zones.

The most important function is flexibility ‚Äî being able to reconfigure spaces quickly without them feeling empty or awkward.
