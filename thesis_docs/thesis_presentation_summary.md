# MaCAD Thesis Presentation Summary
## Multimodal AI Systems for Professional Spatial Design Workflows

**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Event:** Thesis Review I  
**Presenters:** SEDA & BIEL & MAHNOOR

## Core Research Question
**"How effectively can multimodal AI systems integrate into professional spatial design workflows while maintaining quality standards and enhancing rather than replacing human expertise?"**

---

## Primary Objective
Develop a multi-agent AI system that scaffolds human spatial reasoning through three distinct design phases: **Ideation → Visualization → Materialization**, preventing cognitive offloading while building critical thinking skills in spatial design.

---

## Key Innovation
Rather than automating design decisions, the system uses phase-specific cognitive scaffolding, computer vision analysis, and 3D spatial reasoning to enhance human capabilities through structured progression from concept to realization.

---

## Research Questions Framework

### Q1: Capability
Can multimodal AI systems trained on comprehensive architectural knowledge analyze, extract and interpret architectural spatial relationships from 2D plans and 3D models effectively and integrate spatial analysis with theoretical frameworks to generate expert-level design feedback?

### Q2: Collective Intelligence
What emergent insights and solutions arise from collective multimodal intelligence that are impossible to achieve through individual multimodal agents or single-modal systems?

### Q3: Interactivity
How does interactive multimodal learning that combines visual spatial analysis with conversational development positively affect cognitive enhancement and skill transfer and at what point it begins to reduce designer agency?

### Q4: Integration
How effectively can multimodal AI systems integrate into professional spatial design workflows while maintaining quality standards and enhancing rather than replacing human expertise?

## Multi-Agent System Architecture

### Four Specialized Agents

#### 1. Context Reasoning Agent
- **Function:** Analyzes geometric and topological relationships
- **Focus Areas:** Proportion, circulation, light + orientation, adjacency + hierarchy
- **Output:** Questions spatial relationships and guides geometric reasoning across all phases

#### 2. Knowledge Synthesis Agent
- **Function:** Connects spatial analysis to architectural theory and expertise
- **Capabilities:** Theory to practice grounding, precedent matching, principle synthesis + application, contextual cross-referencing (typology, culture, human needs)
- **Role:** Scaffolds connection of theory to design decisions throughout ideation → visualization → materialization

#### 3. Socratic Dialog Agent
- **Function:** Facilitates critical thinking through strategic questioning
- **Methods:** Surfacing assumptions by challenging, alternative exploration by questioning, critical thinking facilitation
- **Purpose:** Facilitates critical thinking through structured questioning in each phase

#### 4. Cognitive Enhancement Agent
- **Function:** Tracks learning progress and metacognitive development
- **Monitoring:** Learning + reflection, spatial awareness development, design principle internalization, critical thinking evolution
- **Role:** Tracks learning and promotes self-reflection across the complete design process

## Three-Phase Design Process

### Phase 1: Ideation Phase
- **Activities:** Cognitive warm-up and conceptual spatial reasoning
- **Process:** User begins feedback loop data, preprocessing/computer vision, vision language analysis, critique anchor mapping + visualization
- **Agent Focus:** Persona tuning engine, user interaction + feedback loop, data layer

### Phase 2: Visualization Phase
- **Activities:** 2D analysis, computer vision processing, and spatial critique
- **Process:** Image upload, region segmentation + patch extraction, scene graph parsing + geometry extraction, 3D spatial analysis, semantic labeling
- **Agent Focus:** Critique generation via LLM, critique overlay in 3D interface, user interaction + feedback loop

### Phase 3: Materialization Phase
- **Activities:** 3D spatial analysis, semantic understanding, and realization feedback
- **Process:** 3D upload, prompt scaffold, prompt crafting, generation
- **Agent Focus:** Full spatial analysis integration across all four agents

## Context Analysis Framework

### Spatial Analysis Categories
1. **Proportion:** Scale relationships and dimensional harmony
2. **Circulation:** Movement patterns and flow dynamics
3. **Light & Orientation:** Environmental response and illumination
4. **Adjacency & Hierarchy:** Spatial relationships and proximity logic, organizational systems and spatial importance

## Methodology Shift: Addressing Cognitive Offloading

### Original Vision vs. Current Approach
- **Original:** Create multimodal AI tool for mentoring students through cognitive development using master works of Architecture
- **Problem Identified:** Simply narrowing AI selection and tailoring personality traits would continue encouraging cognitive offload
- **New Approach:** Developing scalable mentorship system enforcing constructive feedback where ideas grow symbiotically rather than being given
- **Goal:** Tools that think WITH us, not FOR us, reducing risk of shallow learning patterns

### Focus Area
Collaborative human-AI cognition synergies within largely unexplored domain where AI enhances user's ability to understand, articulate and develop spatial thinking.
