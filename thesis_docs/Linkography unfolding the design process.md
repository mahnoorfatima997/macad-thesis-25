## Series Foreword

As professions go, design is relatively young. The practice of design predates  
professions. In fact, the practice of design — making things to serve a useful  
goal, making tools — predates the human race. Making tools is one of the  
attributes that made us human in the first place.  
Design, in the most generic sense of the word, began over 2.5 million  
years ago when *Homo habilis* manufactured the first tools. Human beings  
were designing well before they began to walk upright. Four hundred thou-  
sand years ago, they began to manufacture spears. By 40,000 years ago, they  
had moved up to specialized tools.  
Urban design and architecture developed 10,000 years ago in Mesopo-  
tamia. Interior architecture and furniture design probably emerged with  
them. It was another 5,000 years before graphic design and typography got  
their start when Sumerians developed cuneiform.  
Today all goods and services are designed. The urge to design — to con-  
sider a situation, imagine a better situation, and act to create that improved  
situation — goes back to our prehuman ancestors.  
Today, the word “ design ” means many things. The common factor link-  
ing them is service. Designers engage in a service profession. Their work  
meets human needs.  
Design is first of all a process. The word “ design ” entered the English  
language in the 1500s as a verb, and the first written citation of the verb is  
dated 1548\. *Merriam-Webster ’ s Collegiate Dictionary* defines the verb “ design ”  
as “ to conceive and plan out in the mind; to have as a specific purpose; to  
devise for a specific function or end. ”  
The first cited use of the noun “ design ” can be traced back to 1588\.  
The *Collegiate Dictionary* defines the noun as “ a particular purpose held in  
view by an individual or group; deliberate, purposive planning; a mental

**x Series Foreword**

project or scheme in which means to an end are laid down. ” Today, we  
design large, complex processes, systems, and services, and to achieve this  
we design the organizations and structures that produce them. Design has  
changed considerably since our remote ancestors made the first stone tools.  
At an abstract level, Herbert Simon ’ s definition covers nearly all instances  
of design. To design, Simon writes, is to devise “ courses of action aimed at  
changing existing situations into preferred ones ” ( *The Sciences of the Artifi-*  
*cial* , second edition, MIT Press, 1982, 129). Design, properly defined, is the  
entire process across the full range of domains required for any outcome.  
However, the design process is always more than a general, abstract way  
of working. Design takes concrete form in the work of the service profes-  
sions that meet human needs. These professions include industrial design,  
graphic design, textile design, furniture design, information design, process  
design, product design, interaction design, transportation design, educa-  
tional design, systems design, urban design, design leadership, and design  
management, as well as architecture, engineering, information technology,  
and computer science.  
The various design professions focus on different subjects and objects.  
They have distinct traditions, methods, and vocabularies, used and put  
into practice by distinct and often dissimilar professional groups. Although  
the traditions dividing these professions are distinct, common boundaries  
sometimes form a border. Where this happens, they serve as meeting points  
where common concerns from two or more professions can lead to a shared  
understanding of design. Today, ten challenges uniting the design profes-  
sions form such a set of common concerns.  
Three performance challenges, four substantive challenges, and three  
contextual challenges bind the design disciplines and professions together  
as a common field. The performance challenges arise because all design pro-  
fessions act on the physical world, address human needs, and generate the  
built environment. In the past, these common attributes were not sufficient  
to transcend the boundaries of tradition. Today, objective changes in the  
larger world give rise to four substantive challenges that are driving con-  
vergence in design practice and research. These are increasingly ambiguous  
boundaries between artifacts, structure, and process; increasingly large-  
scale social, economic, and industrial frames; an increasingly complex envi-  
ronment of needs, requirements, and constraints; and information content  
that often exceeds the value of physical substance. These challenges require

**Series Foreword xi**

new frameworks of theory and method. In professional design practice, we  
often find that design requires interdisciplinary teams with a transdisci-  
plinary focus. Fifty years ago, one designer and an assistant or two might  
have solved most design problems; today, we need skills across several dis-  
ciplines, and the ability to work with, listen to, and learn from each other.  
The first of the three contextual challenges is that design takes place  
in a complex environment in which many projects or products cross the  
boundaries of several organizations. The second is that design must meet  
the expectations of many organizations, stakeholders, producers, and users.  
Third, design has to deal with demands at every level of production, distri-  
bution, reception, and control. These ten challenges require a qualitatively  
different approach to professional design practice than was taken in earlier  
times, when environments were simpler. Individual experience and per-  
sonal development were sufficient for depth and substance in professional  
practice. Though experience and development are still necessary, they are  
no longer sufficient. Most of today ’ s design challenges require analytic and  
synthetic planning skills that cannot be developed through practice alone.  
Professional design practice today involves advanced knowledge. This  
knowledge is not solely a higher level of professional practice. It is also a  
qualitatively different form of professional practice that emerges in response  
to the demands of the information society and the knowledge economy to  
which it gives rise.  
In a recent article ( “ Why Design Education Must Change, ” *Core77* ,  
November 26, 2010), Don Norman challenges the premises and practices  
of the design profession. In the past, designers operated on the belief that  
talent and a willingness to jump into problems with both feet gave them an  
edge in solving problems. Norman writes:

In the early days of industrial design, the work was primarily focused upon physi-  
cal products. Today, however, designers work on organizational structure and social  
problems, on interaction, service, and experience design. Many problems involve  
complex social and political issues. As a result, designers have become applied be-  
havioral scientists, but they are woefully undereducated for the task. Designers often  
fail to understand the complexity of the issues and the depth of knowledge already  
known. They claim that fresh eyes can produce novel solutions, but then they won-  
der why these solutions are seldom implemented, or if implemented, why they fail.  
Fresh eyes can indeed produce insightful results, but the eyes must also be edu-  
cated and knowledgeable. Designers often lack the requisite understanding. Design  
schools do not train students about these complex issues, about the interlocking

**xii Series Foreword**

complexities of human and social behavior, about the behavioral sciences, technol-  
ogy, and business. There is little or no training in science, the scientific method, and  
experimental design.

This is not industrial design in the sense of designing products, but industry-  
related design — design as thought and action for solving problems and  
imagining new futures.  
The Design Thinking, Design Theory series emphasizes strategic design  
to create value through innovative products and services, emphasizing  
design as service through rigorous creativity, critical inquiry, and sustain-  
able ethics. This rests on a sense of understanding, empathy, and apprecia-  
tion for people, for nature, and for the world we shape through design. Our  
goal as editors is to develop a series of conversations that help designers and  
researchers to serve business, industry, and the public sector for positive  
social and economic outcomes.  
The idea of this series is to present books that bring a new sense of inquiry  
to design, helping to shape a more reflective and stable design discipline  
able to support a stronger profession grounded in empirical research, gen-  
erative concepts, and the solid theory that gives rise to what W. Edwards  
Deming described as profound knowledge in his 1993 book *The New Eco-*  
*nomics for Industry, Government, Education*. For Deming, a physicist, engi-  
neer, and designer, profound knowledge comprised systems thinking and  
the understanding of processes embedded in systems; an understanding of  
variation and the tools we need to understand variation; a theory of knowl-  
edge; and a foundation in human psychology. This is the beginning of  
“ deep design ” — the union of deep practice with robust intellectual inquiry.  
A series on design thinking and theory faces many of the same chal-  
lenges as the design professions themselves. On one level, design is a gen-  
eral human process that we use to understand and to shape our world.  
Nevertheless, we cannot address this process or the world in its general,  
abstract form. Rather, we seek to meet the challenges of design in specific  
challenges, addressing problems or ideas in a situated context. The chal-  
lenges we face as designers today are as diverse as the problems our clients  
bring us. We are involved in design for economic anchors, economic con-  
tinuity, and economic growth. We design for urban needs and rural needs,  
for social development, and for creative communities. We are involved  
with environmental sustainability, with economic policy, with agricul-  
ture, with competitive crafts for export, with competitive products and

**Series Foreword xiii**

brands for micro-enterprises, with developing new products for bottom-of-  
pyramid markets, and with redeveloping old products for mature or wealthy  
markets. Within the framework of design, we are also challenged to design  
for extreme situations, for biotech, nanotech, and new materials, and for  
social business, as well as facing conceptual challenges for worlds that do  
not yet exist, such as the world beyond the Kurzweil singularity — and for  
new visions of the world that does exist.  
The Design Thinking, Design Theory series explores these issues and  
others — meeting them, examining them, and helping designers to address  
them.  
Join us in this exploration.

## Preface

This book has been very long in the making. My work on linkography was  
initiated in 1988 while I was at MIT, on leave from the Technion — the Israel  
Institute of Technology. After further development of the concept, a first  
paper on linkography was presented at the Tenth European Meeting on  
Cybernetics and Systems Research in Vienna in 1990\. Much to my surprise,  
the paper was received very well and was honored as one of the two best  
papers presented at the conference. This was encouraging, of course, and  
in the next few years two more papers about linkography and its use as a  
research method were written. One of these was honored as the best paper  
published in the journal *Design Studies* in 1995\.  
For more than a decade now, colleagues have been encouraging me  
to write a more comprehensive text. Some years ago, I wrote a few dozen  
pages. That beginning was not followed through, however, because I felt  
that something was still missing; that more work would have to be done  
before a book could be undertaken. Only quite recently have I been able  
to convince myself that I am as ready as I will ever be to finally write the  
book, though clearly more work still remains to be done on many aspects  
of linkography.  
Portions of the studies featured in this book have been published as jour-  
nal papers, by me and by others, but the book is in no way a compendium  
of papers. Rather, existing publications served as inputs to the book. The  
original empirical research that informed the studies described in the book  
(excluding chapter 7\) is briefly reported in the appendix.  
Although I cannot point to a specific influence that led to this book,  
there are certainly people and institutions that contributed indirectly by  
shaping my thinking and serving as intellectual stimulation. First and fore-  
most among them was my teacher, and later colleague and dear friend,

**xvi Preface**

the late Abraham Wachman, whose morphology classes were exciting and  
thought provoking, and who set me on a path of scholarly pursuit. He  
challenged me more than once with his demands for precision and clarity,  
which were lessons for life. Donald Sch ö n was a valuable source of inspira-  
tion, and during my time at MIT he was helpful in serving as a model for  
inquiry and providing critical feedback, which was invaluable to me while  
I was struggling to turn from a practitioner to a researcher. A two-year stay  
at MIT in this crucial phase of my life was a wonderful opportunity to be  
exposed to academic pursuit at its best. I consider myself very fortunate for  
having had the opportunity to gain inspiration and insights from countless  
formal and informal encounters with great thinkers whom I met at MIT. I  
would like to single out John Habraken, William Porter, and Larry Bucci-  
arelli, who remain close colleagues to this very day. I am grateful to MIT for  
instilling in me values and passions that have guided my academic pursuits.  
Another institution to which I am grateful is the Delft University of  
Technology, in particular the Department of Product Innovation Manage-  
ment in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. I have been associ-  
ated with this school for two decades, and I spent a sabbatical year there in  
2005 – 06\. The friendship I encountered there, the encouragement, and the  
openness to new ideas made for an ideal work environment. In particular,  
Petra Badke-Schaub was a wonderful hostess, fully supportive of the link-  
ography enterprise. Thanks to the faculty members and students who were  
so kind and supportive, Delft has become another home away from home,  
as MIT had been.  
Howard Gruber, Tamar Globerson, and Bernard Kaplan, and later Sidney  
Strauss, helped me come to grips with questions related to developmen-  
tal psychology and creativity. Danny Gopher provided an introduction to  
experimental cognitive psychology, and the seminar on Human Factors  
Research he headed at the Technion, which I attended for years, was both  
instructive and a model of exacting research standards.  
Sincere thanks are extended to the many participants in the empirical  
studies reported in this book. They volunteered their time and were patient  
with occasional mishaps that prolonged the experimental sessions. Where  
names of participants are mentioned, they are fictitious.  
I also want to thank the many students who took part in my gradu-  
ate seminar Cognitive Aspects of the Design Process, wherein linkography  
was introduced as a possible addition to “ classical ” protocol analysis. Their

**Preface xvii**

challenging questions and comments forced me to think of new ways to  
develop the theory and application of linkography. Some of the students  
went on to write brilliant term papers, and in some cases master ’ s theses,  
using linkography. They taught me that there is no limit to inventiveness  
and creativity, and what they did with linkography was always a refreshing  
and pleasant surprise.  
I am grateful to Eilam Tycher for his kind, careful, and patient work in  
upgrading many of the figures. I would like to extend my heartiest thanks  
to the individuals who wrote the code that made digital production of  
linkographs possible. The first version, meant for Macintosh computers,  
was called MacLinkograph. It was written by Shahar Dumai, then a teen-  
ager, who also wrote a manual for it. Later a new version was written on a  
Java platform. The budget allowed for only a very limited amount of devel-  
opment, but we still use this application, called Linkographer, which was  
written by Konstantin Zertsekel, Robert Sayegh, and Hanna Mousa. Hanna  
Mousa has been a talented and kind savior angel ever since, solving sticky  
problems that came up occasionally. Many thanks also to Doug Sery, my  
editor at the MIT Press.  
I am also indebted to the National Endowment for the Arts for research  
grant 87-4251-0169 at the outset of this endeavor, which allowed for an  
incubation period that was crucial to the formation of the initial concepts  
of linkography.

## 1 Beginnings

Beginnings, I

Linkography is the outcome of a long chain of experiences that can be  
pinpointed only partially and only with hindsight. Some of these experi-  
ences can be described only in general terms; others have a precise timing  
attached to them. The very first of these events took place a long time ago,  
but the exact date can still be cited: On November 17, 1964, I happened  
to notice a copy of Christopher Alexander ’ s book Notes on the Synthesis of  
Form in a small bookstore in my home city, Jerusalem. Attracted to the  
book beyond resistance, I purchased it. The sales receipt is reproduced here  
as figure 1..  
I was a beginning architecture student at the time, and I understood  
only part of what Alexander wrote, but it was reassuring to get a sense that  
designing is a structured process that can be explained and analyzed. Years  
later, I returned to Notes on the Synthesis of Form and reread it in its entirety.  
Decades later, I can now explain precisely what I found — and still find — so  
attractive about the book. I cannot, however, fully account for my intuitive  
response to it then, nor is there an explanation for the fact that the book  
had reached that little bookstore, in what was then a small, isolated, and  
rather provincial city, so soon after its publication.  
In architecture school we learned how to design by doing it. We would  
come to class with our ideas drawn up, and we would get feedback from  
our teachers before making the next step or going back to modify our draw-  
ings. Alexander ’ s book revealed to me that designing can be clarified — that  
there is a logic to it, and that it is not pure magic. Furthermore, the process  
of designing can be researched. I will discuss Alexander ’ s contribution at

**2 Chapter 1**

some length in chapter 2; here I only want to make the point that when I  
first came across it I had a strong intuition that it was important and that I  
should make an effort to understand it.

**Beginnings, II**

A decade later, already an architect with some experience, I began to teach  
design. I spent many hours in the studio, trying to help students with their  
design projects. In my first few years of teaching, I taught students at dif-  
ferent levels, mostly in first-year and second-year studios. It was impossible  
not to notice how their rates of learning, their thinking, and their reason-  
ing varied, and how comments that were useful to one student were not  
necessarily helpful to another. This variation raised a lot of questions about  
thinking, reasoning, and learning in design, a field in which no amount of  
declarative knowledge can seriously shape the process of idea generation  
and in which procedural knowledge is mostly accumulated individually  
with experience. I knew I wanted to know more about how designers —  
novice and experienced — think, how they generate ideas, and how they  
put ideas to the test, combine them into something meaningful. Why are

**Beginnings 3**

some designers better and more creative than others? What is it that a good  
or an experienced designer does that a less brilliant or novice designer does  
not do?  
My experience in a design workshop for children in 1985 (see Gold-  
schmidt 1994a) led to a number of insights into individual differences and  
about reasoning in general. It seemed that the children ’ s reasoning was  
not entirely different from that of professional designers, although the  
knowledge they possessed and used was obviously not the same. I real-  
ized that I would have to turn to psychology for some of the answers. I  
approached developmental psychologists, and discovered a fascinating  
world of research. Little by little, though, I came to realize that *cognitive*  
psychology was really the field I should look into. That realization opened  
a vast and wonderful treasure box.  
At the same time, I reflected on my own design processes as a practi-  
tioner and, before that, as a student. Why was it sometimes difficult to  
generate good ideas? What was I doing right on some occasions and less so  
on others? The “ front edge ” of the design process — the race to secure good  
design ideas that are capable of “ carrying ” a design solution — became the  
topic I wanted to focus on.

**Beginnings, III**

On a summer ’ s day in 1988, I was sunbathing next to the small swimming  
pool of the condo in which I was living in the Brighton neighborhood of  
Boston, Massachusetts. I was on sabbatical at MIT and was working on my  
research for the National Endowment for the Arts, which was titled “ Nota-  
tion Systems for Processes of Designing. ” I had the background written up,  
but an actual notation was yet to be devised. Hoping that the refreshing  
poolside environment would also refresh my thoughts, I sat there with my  
papers and stared at the water. The only precedent I could think of for the  
notation I had in mind was a notation my former student Eduardo Naisberg  
had developed for the purpose of representing students ’ design decisions  
in the course of a short design process (see Naisberg 1986). An example of  
Naisberg ’ s notation is shown here in figure 1.2.  
It was clear that Naisberg ’ s notation, elegant as it was, was not the solution  
to what I had been trying to achieve, but for a long time my experimenta-  
tion with various other notations was unsatisfactory. I had been introduced

the end is marked by a circle) when decisions are withdrawn. Bold lines represent

**Beginnings 5**

to protocol analysis a short while earlier, and I found that method most  
appropriate and promising for the analysis of design processes at a fine  
granularity. I had also recently been introduced to cognitive psychology,  
which fascinated me and which provided a good framework for my inter-  
est in designers ’ thinking processes. Thus, I decided to base a notation on  
parsed protocols. But none of the coding systems I came up with seemed to  
generate any meaningful insights. At the poolside in Brighton, I decided to  
let go of coding, and I experienced an “ Aha\! ” moment. On the grid paper I  
had brought with me, I scribbled the first hesitant linkograph-like notation.  
The next day, I tried desperately to reproduce my crude pencil notation on  
my newly acquired Macintosh SE. The first attempts were rather frustrat-  
ing, and it was quite a while before I could draw anything coherent on the  
Mac. For a long time I continued to use large sheets of grid paper, pencils,  
and erasers. The concept of the linkograph evolved and acquired depth  
and breadth with use; each time a problem or a deficiency was discovered,  
the system had to be augmented with new capabilities or re-inspected alto-  
gether. To this day, our means of producing linkographs, the digital linkog-  
rapher, is far from perfect, but we use it anyway.  
After an initial report to the National Endowment for the Arts, I pre-  
sented linkography at a cybernetics conference in Vienna (Goldschmidt  
1990). A great opportunity arose in 1994, when I was invited to participate  
in what would eventually come to be known as the Delft protocol work-  
shop. A number of researchers in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engi-  
neering at the Delft University of Technology, led by Nigel Cross, became  
interested in protocol analysis, which had become popular with researchers  
studying design thinking. They wanted to explore protocol analysis as a  
method for design research, and perhaps to plot its potential and its limita-  
tions. They invented a design task and went to Xerox ’ s Palo Alto Research  
Center to experiment with it. The task was given to volunteer experienced  
designers, some working individually and some in teams, under similar  
controlled conditions. The sessions were videotaped. Two of the tapes (one  
representing the work of an individual and one the work of a three-person  
team), and the protocols that were transcribed from them, were sent to  
about two dozen design researchers who were experienced in protocol anal-  
ysis, and they were invited to analyze the protocols by whatever method  
they wanted to use. When the analyses came in, the authors were invited  
to present them in a workshop. The fact that they all had worked from

**6 Chapter 1**

the same data made for very focused discussions. The papers that resulted  
were published in a special issue of *Design Studies* (volume 16, issue 2, 1995,  
guest edited by Kees Dorst) and in a book titled *Analysing Design Activity*  
(Cross et al. 1996). At the workshop, I presented a paper in which I used  
linkography to compare the process of the individual and that of the team  
(Goldschmidt 1995, 1996). On that occasion I discovered the potential of  
critical moves as a central feature of linkography.  
Since then, progress has centered on details and further features of linko-  
graphs, but at the same time the theory behind linkography has been built  
up and the scope of its applicability has been extended. Somewhat unusu-  
ally, the application preceded the theory to a large extent. In this specific  
case, research was very similar to design and was largely a bottom-up pro-  
cess that, by way of confirmation of experimental findings, also went back  
to theory in a top-down manner. That is, first there was the linkograph; its  
potential had to be discovered little by little. Tying it in with theory hap-  
pened later. Of course, the initial reason for developing the “ tool ” had to  
do with theory, but this theory was largely implicit at first. I would claim  
that this hand-in-hand development of the “ product ” and its rationale was  
a typical design process. Therefore, it may be far from a chance occurrence  
that linkography was proposed by someone with a design background.  
Chapter 2 of this book outlines the history of design thinking research in  
the last half-century, with an emphasis on the contribution of Christopher  
Alexander. Alexander published the most original, comprehensive, and  
well-thought-out work on design as a rational process wherein a problem  
is decomposed into subsets. The designer ’ s task is to remove any misfits  
among responses to the subsets. The “ good fit ” that is to be achieved is  
a very important concept that has implications for linkography. Chapter  
2 also presents and discusses protocol analysis as the major methodology  
used in research on design thinking.  
Chapter 3 focuses on what is taken to be the goal of the search that  
occurs at the “ front edge ” of the design process: a design synthesis. The  
synthesis is an idea, a concept, or a selection of ideas or concepts that can  
be used to support a comprehensive, coherent design solution — something  
that is possible only if the design acts that implement such ideas are in  
congruence with one another, or (to use Alexander ’ s term) if they display  
“ good fit ” among themselves. Generating, inspecting, and adjusting ideas  
is a process that evolves over a large number of small steps that I call *design*

**Beginnings 7**

*moves*. From there it is a short step to a notion of a network of moves. The  
next step is the recognition of links among these moves as the manner in  
which a good fit is achieved. The notion of two modes of thinking, diver-  
gent and convergent, is also introduced in this chapter.  
Chapter 4 describes the features and the notational conventions of the  
linkograph. It dwells on different kinds of moves and explains what aspects  
of the design process can be observed and measured in a linkograph. In  
addition to what may be referred to as the standard notation, a variant  
notation that has been proposed to replace or extend the standard linko-  
graph is introduced.  
Chapter 5 focuses on critical moves, arguably the most significant ele-  
ment in a linkograph. Critical moves are moves that are particularly rich  
in links. The chapter explains why this makes them important. The bulk of  
the chapter presents various studies in which critical moves are the key to  
investigations of specific topics related to design thinking.  
Chapter 6 is devoted to design creativity — more specifically, to the cre-  
ative process in design. Linkography is particularly well suited to the study  
of this important aspect of the design process. Here I return to divergent  
and convergent thinking and show how they are manifested in linko-  
graphs. Again, a number of cases are used to illustrate the points made.  
Chapter 7 introduces thirteen linkographic studies conducted by other  
researchers who brought fresh insights to their investigations and reported  
interesting findings that extend the utility of linkography in many ways.  
These studies, which are quite varied, were selected in order to demon-  
strate the potential of linkography as a research tool in design thinking and  
beyond.  
The book concludes with a short epilogue and an appendix that lists the  
main studies on which the cases discussed in the text are based.

## 2 Design Thinking Research

**The Introduction of Design Methods**

After World War II, many design disciplines throughout the industrial-  
ized world — especially architecture — experienced considerable transitions.  
The widespread destruction in Europe required unprecedented planning,  
design, and construction efforts. In North America the rapid growth of sub-  
urbs required novel approaches to design and planning. Practitioners every-  
where felt unprepared for the challenges of designing large neighborhoods,  
entire new towns, and expansive road systems. Urban renewal projects had  
to respond to new welfare-state sensitivities and higher expectations in  
terms of building standards and performance requirements. A vast increase  
in higher education demanded a re-conceptualization of university and col-  
lege campuses. Elementary and secondary education also required mod-  
ernized facilities to suit new educational paradigms and values in largely  
transformed societies. Shopping malls destabilized traditional urban com-  
mercial patterns and changed the nature of towns. Accelerated technologi-  
cal development, partially as a result of the war, contributed to a shift from  
heavy industry to high-tech industry. The advent of the computer and the  
rapid development of computation and communication were, of course,  
the peaks of this revolution. Technological education followed suit, and  
new design disciplines were created, among them computer hardware and  
software engineering. Other disciplines underwent serious developmen-  
tal transformations. Designers in all fields faced much greater uncertainty  
than they had in the past, and had to cope with many unknowns and  
with new needs for flexibility and change. The war effort had fostered col-  
laborative work in which designers and scientists from different fields had  
joined forces to achieve specific goals. This experience created a favorable

**10 Chapter 2**

environment for interdisciplinary work, for which appropriate frameworks  
had to be invented (Broadbent 1973; Heims 1991). Traditional design edu-  
cation had not prepared designers sufficiently for the scope and nature of  
the new challenges, and they felt that the tools of their various trades fell  
short of what was required.  
The tools of the trade(s) came under close scrutiny by designers and  
design researchers, who thought that traditional design methods had failed  
them and had produced unsatisfactory results. Architects experienced a  
particularly acute crisis, perhaps because they were in a position to evaluate  
and be unhappy with much that was built immediately after the war and  
through the 1950s in Europe and elsewhere. Direct and indirect negative  
feedback from users — for instance, vandalism in new housing projects — left  
little room for misunderstanding: people ’ s needs were not being addressed  
adequately, and designers felt a pressing obligation to do something about  
it. Therefore, it is not surprising that architects were in the forefront and in  
the majority among the design researchers who sought to revolutionize the  
practice of designing.

**The Design Methods Movement**

In the early 1960s the design research community was ready to act on  
its members ’ wish to modify the practice of design. Much of the research  
was carried out in Britain, and it was there that an interest in what came  
to be called “ design methods ” was nurtured. In 1963 the first confer-  
ence on design methods was convened at London ’ s Imperial College of  
Science and Technology (Jones and Thornley 1963). It was followed by  
two more conferences dedicated to design methods in the same decade,  
one held in 1965 at the Birmingham College of Advanced Technology  
(Gregory 1966\) and one in 1967 at the Portsmouth School of Architecture  
(Broadbent and Ward 1969). Proceedings were published after each of these  
three conferences. Across the ocean, another conference on design meth-  
ods (the “ First International Conference of the Design Methods Group ” — as  
it turned out, there was no second) took place in 1968 at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology. Despite differences among these meetings, and  
certainly among viewpoints that were expressed in them by attendees  
from a wide range of disciplines, today we notice the commonalties more  
than the variances. Taken together, the people who were active in these

**Design Thinking Research 11**

initiatives and similar ones, and the work they accomplished, are now  
often referred to as the Design Methods movement, and that appellation is  
adopted here.  
Members of the Design Methods movement shared the conviction that  
the process of designing, which was traditionally seen as being based largely  
on conventions, experience, and intuition (possibly “ educated intuition ” ),  
should be thoroughly modified or altogether replaced by a more advanced  
process. Design, it was believed, should aspire to become a science, and  
designing should be based on systematic, scientific design methods that  
would draw on research and would be teachable and learnable. Herbert  
Simon presented a solidified view of a “ science of design ” in one of his  
1968 Karl Taylor Compton Lectures at MIT (the text is reprinted in Simon  
1982). By and large, designing was seen as problem solving, the structure  
of which was taken to be similar in all design disciplines. Accordingly, con-  
tributors to the conferences on design methods included, in addition to  
architects, representatives of other design disciplines, most of them engi-  
neers. An interest in systematic problem solving was common to all the  
participants, and hence there were attempts to adapt procedures that had  
been developed in systems analysis, in operational research, and in other  
fields to the solving of design problems. The then-new field of cybernetics  
was invoked because of its focus on the behavior of systems (Heims 1991).  
In a tentative science of design, designing was seen as a logical process, one  
controlled by rules that could be explicated and prescribed.  
Many a proposed method took the form of a prescriptive model com-  
prising operational design steps (or stages), each to be executed before the  
designer was supposed to move to the next step. Iterations were included to  
allow repetition of former steps with new information or insights resulting  
from feedback emanating from outcomes of earlier steps. In this view there  
was no difference between the design process and a design method; the  
method was the process. Most of the models yielded flow charts of the type  
shown here in figure 2.1. In some design domains — especially mechanical  
engineering — such models are still in use today (see, e.g., Hubka and Eder  
1982, 1996; Pahl and Beitz 1984/1996; Pugh 1991; Roozenberg and Eekels  
1995; Ullman 1992; Heath 1984).  
Despite variations and some disagreement concerning proposed and  
hypothetical methods and systems, one basic model of the design process  
gained consensual acceptance by the entire Design Methods community.

**12 Chapter 2**

**Figure 2.1**  
Typical flow chart of a design process or method.

According to this highly simplified model, “ systematic design is a three-  
stage process, demanding analysis, synthesis and evaluation ” (Page 1963,

205. Many of the prescriptive proposals were elaborations of the Analysis –  
     Synthesis – Evaluation model.  
     The Analysis – Synthesis – Evaluation (ASE) model of the design process,  
     first proposed by Morris Asimow (1962), quickly gained wide acceptance. R.  
     D. Watts (1966), for example, took the ASE model very much for granted,  
     and his adaptation of a diagram by Mihajlo Mesarovi ć (1964) describing the  
     design process in terms of this model has been reproduced so many times  
     that it has become standard. Figure 2.2 is a slightly modified version of that  
     diagram.  
     The depiction of the design process as a series of spiraling iterative  
     cycles that move from the abstract to the concrete provided a powerful  
     image, and the spiral metaphor was used by many to describe the design  
     process. The terminology varies, but in all cases the spiral is meant to

**Design Thinking Research 13**

convey the movement from a wide (abstract) problem space to a specific  
(concrete) solution selected for its good fit with the requirements of the  
task. This is achieved through the iterative use of analysis, synthesis, and  
evaluation as prescribed by the particular design method used (see, e.g.,  
Zeisel 1981).  
The ASE model is based on a paradigm of problem solving as informa-  
tion processing, a paradigm that underlay much of the period ’ s scientific  
thinking and contributed to the founding of cognitive science and artificial  
intelligence. John Luckman (1969) defined and commented on the three  
stages of the model as follows:

(i) Analysis: The collection and classification of all relevant information relating to  
the design problem on hand.  
(ii) Synthesis: The formulation of potential solutions to parts of the problem which  
are feasible when judged against the information contained in the Analysis stage.  
(iii) Evaluation: The attempt to judge by use of some criterion or criteria which of  
the feasible solutions is the one most satisfactorily answering the problem.

In practice, for all but very small design problems, the whole process of design will  
consist of many levels, progressing from very general considerations at the start,  
through to specific details as the project nears completion.

**Figure 2.2**  
Spiral model of design process (after Watts 1966; based on Mesarovi ć 1964).

**14 Chapter 2**

Thus, a level is synonymous with a sub-problem within the total problem where  
a set of interconnected decisions must be taken, and at every level to a greater or  
lesser degree, the stages of Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation are used. (ibid., 129\)

The premise is that designing is a combinatorial problem-solving process  
in which analysis of a body of available information (which must first be  
collected) is used to generate candidate solutions to the problem, or to sub-  
problems. Candidate solutions are compared and assessed, and the most  
appropriate solution is then selected. This process is iterative, and normally  
the designer goes through several cycles of analysis, synthesis, and evalu-  
ation. The model assumes that, although a certain amount of flexibility is  
built into the process by facilitating feedback from one level to the next, on  
the whole the goals, constraints, and performance criteria of the design task  
are defined at the outset, and their transparency makes them accessible and  
explicable at any point in the process. John Chris Jones (1969) referred to  
the rational designer (i.e., one who subscribes to the use of rational design  
methods) as a “ glass box, ” thus endorsing the view that performance crite-  
ria are, or should be, transparent.  
Generally speaking, the Design Methods movement aspired to do away  
with any design tradition that was deemed “ non-scientific. ” In sharp con-  
trast with the past, it shied away from seeing design as an art, because art  
was conceived of as antithetical to science. Even freehand drawing, an  
age-old means of design exploration and representation, became suspect,  
as it leans heavily on intuition and craftsmanship and not on the logical  
application of a systematic method. How, then, was the form of a designed  
entity to be worked out? The computer was, of course, the great new hope,  
indeed promise. Computational drafting techniques were just beginning  
to be contemplated in the early 1960s, but, in line with the scientific para-  
digm, it was hoped and believed that computing would eventually make  
it possible to automate large portions of the design process, if not all of  
it. Replacing freehand drawing with precise machine-generated drawings  
was an early goal of what was to develop into computer-aided design  
(CAD). “ Experiments are being made on working out shapes on a cathode-  
ray tube presentation, ” Sydney Gregory (1966, 5\) declared. “ This kind of  
shape presentation may be readily converted into a punched tape commu-  
nication. ” Such developments were met with great enthusiasm, as they rep-  
resented a departure from craftsmanship in favor of a more trusted, more

**Design Thinking Research 15**

“ advanced ” scientific procedure. The history of CAD and CAAD (computer-  
aided architectural design) is well documented (see, e.g., Kalay 2004; Mark  
et al. 2008), as is the history of the Design Methods movement (see, e.g.,  
Bayazit 2004).  
Digital drawing was but one way in which computation was believed  
to be potentially useful in design. Evaluation, and therefore selection of  
candidate solutions, was another and possibly more important application  
domain. The information-processing paradigm of problem solving called  
for the generation of all — or most — plausible solutions (through a built-  
in process of optimization), and then the selection of the highest-rating  
solution, or the one with the best fit with the problem requirements. As  
has already been mentioned, design was seen as a typical problem-solving  
situation. According to Gordon Best (1969, 147), “ designing can be usefully  
interpreted as a variety-reducing process. ” Early versions of Space Allocation  
or Adjacency Programs, in which criteria for adjacency of spaces (rooms)  
within a building were fed into a computer and assisted in creating layout  
diagrams that established desired adjacencies among spaces in a plan, were  
introduced. The most influential attempt to devise a complete system for  
the analysis of design problems and the synthesis of solutions was proposed  
by Christopher Alexander. This work anticipated the use of computational  
tools to assist in breaking problems into manageable subsets, in which  
misfits among candidate solution forms and the problem context could be  
sorted out. Alexander summarized that work in 1964 in *Notes on the Synthe-*  
*sis of Form*. That widely acclaimed book has affected design thinking pro-  
foundly for many years, and is probably the most original and significant  
contribution to the literature on design methods, even though Alexander  
later dissociated himself from the Design Methods movement.

**Alexander ’ s** ***Notes on the Synthesis of Form***

The introduction to *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* is titled “ The Need for  
Rationality. ” In its first paragraph, Alexander states that the book is about  
“ the process of design; the process of inventing physical things that display  
new physical order, organization, form, in response to function ” (1964, 1).  
He described a problematic state of design practice that we recognize as the  
reality about which the Design Methods movement complained:

**16 Chapter 2**

Today functional problems are becoming less simple all the time. But designers  
rarely confess their inability to solve them. Instead, when a designer does not un-  
derstand a problem clearly enough to find the order it really calls for, he falls back  
on some arbitrarily chosen formal order. The problem, because of its complexity,  
remains unsolved. (ibid., 1\)

Alexander argued that the solving of a complex problem benefits from  
the application of a suitable method: for instance, by using paper and pen-  
cil and applying ordinary arithmetic conventions, one can easily solve, in  
seconds, an arithmetic problem that is very difficult to solve in one ’ s head.  
But, Alexander claimed, no methods were available to simplify, and thereby  
help solve, complex design problems. Alexander believed that, as in arith-  
metic, in order to simplify a complex design problem one must have a way  
of decomposing it into smaller design problems, each small enough so that  
the designer can deal with it rationally and solve it successfully. Alexander ’ s  
work was devoted to developing and explicating such a method.  
For Alexander “ the ultimate object of design is form ” (ibid., 15), and  
therefore he was concerned with the generation of appropriate form in  
response to a given design task. A form is a successful design solution if,  
and only if, there is a good fit between it and its context, as specified by  
the givens of the task. When a good fit is not achieved, a successful design  
solution is not likely to be found. Because of the complexity of design tasks,  
potential misfits arise frequently. It is the responsibility of the designer to  
remove them by making the right choices and decisions throughout the  
design process. In other words, the task of the designer is not to create form  
that meets certain criteria, but to remove or neutralize all “ incongruities,  
irritants or forces, which cause misfits ” (ibid., 24). This is a heavy burden  
that is normally beyond the cognitive capacity of the designer, unless the  
scope of the problem is quite small. The question, then, is this: How does  
one decompose a large and complex problem into local, manageable, prob-  
lems or subproblems?  
Alexander distinguished between relatively simple “ unselfconscious ”  
cultures and “ selfconscious ” cultures, including those of contemporary  
modern societies, which are more complex. In unselfconscious cultures,  
Alexander observed, there are no explicit “ design theories ” and no profes-  
sional designers. Everything is made according to a tradition that varies  
little over time and that dictates “ right ” ways of doing things. Of critical  
importance is the fact that there exist readily available accepted remedies

**Design Thinking Research 17**

for specific failures, should any occur. Failures, or misfits, may occur when  
variants of typical solutions must be produced as a result of minor changes  
in the context. The unselfconscious culture is seen as “ self-adjusting, ”  
which implies that fitting forms persist in this culture and maintain a  
dynamic equilibrium with the system.  
In a selfconscious culture, forms are made in a very different way. Design  
is a specialized activity, and its translation into actual form is indirect (that  
is, executed by other parties). When failures occur, adjustment is difficult  
because several parties are involved in reporting and describing the fail-  
ures and in making decisions on the best course of action to remedy them.  
Because cultural changes take place rapidly, tradition is a poor guide to  
the making of well-fitting forms. Faced with this reality, the designer, who  
cannot lean on tradition, turns to “ design theories ” and principles that  
take the shape of prescriptions. Whereas the guidance provided by tradi-  
tion is natural and well understood, prescriptions are rigid and often rather  
arbitrary because they are generalized, often quite abstract, and not well  
related to any local, specific condition.  
Alexander recognized that we live in a selfconscious world and that no  
return to an unselfconscious existence is possible. However, he did not give  
up the aspiration to arrive at a good form from which misfits have been  
removed. Accordingly, he saw design as a process of error correction — a  
process that, he suggested, has a personal flavor and depends on common-  
sense-based interpretations. The design method that Alexander proposed  
is aimed at facilitating the process of error reduction and correction by  
imposing structure on the relationships among requirements and form.  
Alexander suggested that a comprehensive list of requirements be prepared  
for each subproblem. Checking requirements against other requirements  
reveals misfits, and requirements must then be adjusted in order to elimi-  
nate them. Needless to say, for complex problems the lists of requirements  
may be very long, and working through them may be laborious.  
*Notes on the Synthesis of Form* concludes with a “ worked example ” con-  
cerning the reorganization of a village in rural India. The example was also  
presented in a paper at the first Conference on Design Method, held in Lon-  
don in 1963\. Alexander was a major figure in the emerging Design Methods  
movement at the time, and within a few years of its publication *Notes on*  
*the Synthesis of Form* was one of the most influential design-theory trea-  
tises of its time. The method that Alexander propagated, however, has not

**18 Chapter 2**

fared equally well. In fact, after several attempts to implement it in practice,  
Alexander himself conceded that it was too laborious and cumbersome. At  
the same time, comparisons between design solutions that were generated  
using the method and schemes developed in a habitual manner without it  
failed to prove that the former had any visible advantages or superior qual-  
ity. Alexander was the first to recognize that he was unable to resolve the  
problem, at least not until sufficiently advanced computational techniques  
would become available. He abandoned this line of work and turned to an  
independent exploration of the diagrams he had arrived at, later referred to  
as *patterns* (Alexander et al. 1977). The patterns had also been of great inter-  
est to the design community, and later they would be of interest to com-  
puter science. The unrealized hope that the method proposed in *Notes* had  
ignited continued to inspire researchers who refused to give up on it long  
after Alexander himself did. Unfortunately, no real successes were recorded.  
Alexander later claimed that those who had “ even made a cult of fol-  
lowing this method ” had misunderstood his intentions and should have  
concentrated on the ability to produce diagrams, or patterns, instead of  
focusing on the method that leads to their creation. In the preface to the  
paperback edition of *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* , Alexander wrote: “ I have  
been hailed as one of the leading exponents of these so-called design meth-  
ods. I am very sorry that this has happened, and want to state, publicly, that  
I reject the whole idea of design methods as a subject of study. ” (1971, ii)

**Descriptive Design Models**

To the Design Methods community, the great appeal of the method that  
Alexander described in *Notes* was the revelation that a productive theory of  
architectural design was possible (Grabow 1983). The method was seen as  
a demonstration of a rule-based, prescriptive system with which the entire  
design process could be managed. The fact that a mathematical model had  
been used and the fact that computation was to be employed must have  
added to the allure of the method. The realization that this elegant, sophis-  
ticated method delivered no practical solution to the afflictions of design  
practice was so disappointing that it took a long time to sink in. In fact,  
two decades ’ worth of hard work in the domain of design methods has had  
a negligible effect on most design domains, with the possible exception of  
engineering design. In architecture schools, where most of the work was

**Design Thinking Research 19**

done, students and faculty members alike found the implementation of  
various experimental methods laborious, time consuming, and unexciting.  
Worse, they noted that no enhancement could be perceived in the resul-  
tant design solutions.  
For a long time, researchers believed that imperfections in the methods  
they had developed were responsible for the lack of success. The response  
was to try harder, and primarily to look for ways in which computation  
could be utilized in designing. This effort led to impressive advances in  
computer-aided design but had no effect on the way designers conceptual-  
ized their problems and launched searches for solutions. It was no longer  
possible to account for the lack of effectiveness of methods solely by point-  
ing to imperfections in them. Clearly, other reasons had to be considered.  
By the mid 1970s, a small number of researchers had begun to suspect that  
the customary modes of thinking that designers made use of as they went  
about their business — practices the Design Methods movement sought to  
abolish or at least transform — were natural and perhaps innate ways of  
dealing with tasks such as designing. Designers, it was observed, appear to  
use steadfast modes of thinking that resist attempts to divert them from  
their natural course. The prescriptive nature of the various methods, which  
demanded that the designer follow predetermined steps in a fairly rigid  
order, seemed to be at odds with what was conceived of as “ natural design  
thinking. ” If this view is accepted, it follows that instead of fighting natural  
design thinking one should go along with it, and that it could be supported  
if the means of support were well fitted to human design thinking.  
The notion that intuitive design thinking might not be so objectionable  
after all required a change of paradigm. Researchers began to talk about  
“ descriptive design models, ” which they contrasted with prescriptive mod-  
els or methods. The argument was that good descriptions of actual design  
behavior were essential to progress in understanding thinking as it occurs  
in real-life design practice. This was understood by researchers who were  
interested in developing computational tools that could assist designers  
in the early, conceptual phases of the design process. Instead of dream-  
ing of a computational tool that would replace the human designer, they  
began to talk about a partnership between the designer and the computer  
in which each partner would contribute what he, she, or it was best at (see,  
e.g., Swerdloff and Kalay 1987). It was thereby acknowledged that human  
designers did certain things better than computers, by which researchers

**20 Chapter 2**

usually meant that humans were better at generating new ideas. But there  
was a serious difficulty with the new paradigm: it turned out that, in fact,  
very little was known about how designers think and, in particular, about  
how they generate and develop ideas. Without better knowledge and  
understanding of design thinking, how would it be possible to ensure a  
good fit between it and any tools, computational or otherwise, that were  
to be developed?

**The Impact of Cognitive Psychology**

Researchers became aware of the lack of knowledge about the intricacies  
of design thinking when the new science of cognition had begun to illu-  
minate various issues related to “ mind, ” including problem solving (which  
was, and is, often equated with thinking). One of the research themes was  
domain specificity in thinking — for instance, what is specific to mathemati-  
cal thinking, musical talent, or chess mastery. A handful of design research-  
ers who believed that understanding design thinking was a prerequisite  
to the development of design-support tools conducted the first studies  
of design thinking. Not surprisingly, that work was initiated at Carnegie  
Mellon University, where Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and associates had  
done their pioneering work on information processing and problem solv-  
ing (see, e.g., Newell and Simon 1972). Young design researchers there were  
exposed to that work and influenced by it; a case in point is Ö mer Akin,  
whose studies of the design process show the influence of the information  
processing paradigm (see Akin 1976 and, especially, Akin 1986).  
The solidification of cognitive psychology as a separate area of study  
within psychology paralleled the establishment of cognitive science as a  
new and multi-disciplinary field. A major force behind these developments  
was the impact that computation had on researchers of thinking — an  
impact that led to the Computational Theory of Mind (see, e.g., Putnam  
1975; Fodor 1975; Pylyshyn 1986). Essentially, the Computational Theory  
of Mind saw thinking as information processing that depended largely on  
genetically inherited neurological and mental structures rather than (as had  
been thought under the theory of behaviorism, the dominant paradigm  
in psychology up to that time) on environmental factors (on behaviorism,  
see Skinner 1974). Several decades earlier, Gestalt psychology had con-  
cerned itself with perception, and had taken it to be essential to problem

**Design Thinking Research 21**

solving. Generic principles of perception had been formulated, and empiri-  
cal evidence had been used to instantiate them (Wertheimer 1923/1938).  
That innovative work had been rejected later by the first generation of  
cognitive psychologists on the ground that it lacked scientific validity.  
Scientific soundness was to be gained through controlled behavioral experi-  
ments with statistically sustained conclusions, which the Gestalt psycholo-  
gists did not attempt to provide. However, Gestalt psychology did not die  
away; in later years, researchers who acknowledged its importance adopted  
its insights and continued to develop them under what is sometimes called  
“ Neo Gestalt ” (Robertson 1986). The principles of perception that the  
Gestalt psychologists set forth and their cognitive psychology successors  
refined and amplified were especially relevant to design thinking because  
they were highly connected with visual thinking. Rudolf Arnheim ’ s influ-  
ential books *Art and Visual Perception* (1954) and *Visual Thinking* (1969) are  
considered landmarks in research on design thinking and artistic thinking  
to this day.  
A critical event in the history of cognitive science was the Sympo-  
sium on Information Theory held at MIT in 1956, after which one of the  
major participants, the psychologist George Miller, remarked “ It is the  
second day of the symposium (11 September 1956\) that I take to be  
the moment of conception for cognitive science. ” (Miller 2003, 142\) In this  
landmark symposium, linguists, communication scientists, psychologists,  
and others (computer scientists, philosophers, anthropologists, neuroscien-  
tists), many of whom (including Noam Chomsky, Claude Shannon, Allen  
Newell, Herbert Simon, and Miller) would go on to change the scientific  
landscape of the twentieth century, shared the theme of “ mind as an infor-  
mation processor. ” The same year, 1956, saw the publication of *A Study*  
*of Thinking* , in which Jerome Bruner, Jacqueline Goodnow, and George  
Austin reported groundbreaking experimental work on the formation of  
concepts and inductive reasoning. A number of other important events —  
meetings and publications — also occurred during that year. It is no wonder  
that Steven Pinker called 1956 an “ annus mirabilis. ” 1 With hindsight, New-  
ell (1980) reflected on the newly founded cognitive science: “ By general  
accord, a revolution happened in the scientific study of man in the mid  
1950s, shifting the view to man as an active processor of symbolic informa-  
tion. ” (ibid., 14\) “ Symbolic information ” was conceived as embodied in  
representation, external or internal. In 1960, Miller and Bruner founded

the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies. In 1967, Ulrich Neisser published  
*Cognitive Psychology* , which affirmed the “ coming of age ” of the cognitive  
revolution, pertaining equally to psychology and the other disciplines  
involved. The term “ cognitive science ” was first used in 1973 (Longuet-  
Higgins 1987).  
The timing of these developments was opportune for a change of para-  
digm in design research. After it was recognized that design thinking would  
have to be understood better before it could be constructively supported  
by design tools and aids, a science of thinking seemed timely and invit-  
ing. Cognitive science was multi-disciplinary from its inception, and design  
researchers felt that it provided a framework that would allow research on  
design thinking. In view of the influence of Newell and Simon and their  
colleagues, Carnegie Mellon University was a natural breeding ground for  
pioneering studies on design thinking. Design thinking researchers realized  
that they would have to conduct empirical studies based on actual real-life  
evidence. They also recognized that they would have to work at a micro  
scale — that is, with very small units of design activity. The methodology  
they adopted was protocol analysis, to which the last section of this chapter  
is dedicated. Protocol analysis has been in wide use among design research-  
ers for more than 30 years now, as it fits the need to explore small units of  
behavior in empirical settings.  
In parallel to work based on protocol analysis, design thinking research-  
ers conducted many observational studies that were particularly useful for  
long-term studies, for which protocol analysis is not well suited. In Britain,  
which took center stage in the Design Methods enterprise, the transition  
from “ methods ” to more cognition-bound research was gradual. An exam-  
ple is the work of Nigel Cross, whose early work (1984) is in the spirit of  
methods but who later (2006, 2011\) accepted the descriptive design model  
as a research framework. Brian Lawson ’ s *Design Thinking* (1980/2005), one  
of the early descriptive design research texts in Britain, was based on exten-  
sive observations, but Lawson (a psychologist as well as an architect and a  
design researcher) did not attempt a cognitive probing into design thinking.

**Artificial Intelligence in Design**

The computation enthusiasts of the Design Methods era were forced to  
temper their high expectations for the automation of design, but the dream

**Design Thinking Research 23**

did not evaporate altogether. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was born in par-  
allel to cognitive psychology and cognitive science in the 1950s. Because  
cognitive science and artificial intelligence had common roots in informa-  
tion processing, we find some of the same names among their founders,  
including Herbert Simon and Allen Newell. Unlike cognitive psychol-  
ogy, AI looks only at formal reasoning, which, once understood, can be  
modeled and embedded in artificial systems (computers) and can lend  
them an “ intelligence. ” The motivation behind AI research was to create  
problem-solving tools that would take advantage of the computer ’ s huge  
storage capacity and of the possibility of running combinatorial searches  
that would allow a computer to “ reason ” on the basis of formal knowl-  
edge and rules that had been fed into the computational system earlier. An  
example is the chess-playing program Deep Blue, which managed to beat  
the grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997\. The first commercial successes  
came even earlier, in the 1980s, in the form of “ expert systems, ” which  
stored a large number of knowledge instances that could be matched with  
current problems in a domain. For example, there were expert systems for  
medical diagnosis that had at their disposal a huge collection of symptoms  
and their resolutions — the correct diagnoses. However, expert systems are  
limited because in a large system combinatorial explosion can easily result  
in counter-productive results. Robotics is currently one of the most promi-  
nent pragmatic topics in AI; another current topic of research and applica-  
tion is way-finding (e.g., GPS navigation systems). The researchers involved  
are computer scientists who collaborate with experts from other fields,  
including engineering design and psychology. Natural human intelligence  
is studied along with artificial intelligence, which attempts to model it. The  
common tenet is information processing, as was the case when the field  
was first established. Present-day AI also tries to model human intuition  
and judgment, which are not based on combinatorial searches; such efforts  
are particularly relevant to design.  
As soon as AI came of age, some design researchers, especially those with  
strong backgrounds in computer-aided design, subscribed to this branch  
of research with the hope of advancing the partnership between design-  
ers and computational systems. Expert systems gave rise to *case-based rea-*  
*soning* (see, e.g., Kolodner 1988), which attempted to propose solutions,  
mainly to architectural problems, based on libraries of precedents, or cases.  
The indexing system was related to a building ’ s type, its function (e.g., a

**24 Chapter 2**

school), or other formal features, such as a building ’ s form (e.g., a dome)  
or its expected performance (e.g., in energy consumption) (Coyne et al.  
1990; Maher et al. 1995). The representation of knowledge is particularly  
important in AI in general, and in design-related AI in particular, because of  
the visual component of design representations. Rapid freehand sketches,  
which are routinely produced in the process of designing (especially in  
the early search phase), hardly ever comply with formal rules, and there-  
fore they are difficult to formalize for the purpose of modeling the knowl-  
edge embedded in them. Consequently, recognition and interpretation of  
sketches have received a lot of attention in AI in design — see, for example,  
Field et al. 2010 or Gross 1994\. The strong visual aspect of designing is not  
the only characteristic that sets it apart. Since design problems are largely  
ill-structured and ill-defined, it is difficult to define the knowledge that  
should be represented. Creative designers think analogically, and often their  
sources are from unexpected domains (Goel and Bhatta 2004). Combinato-  
rial searches are, therefore, not very useful in supporting the creative idea-  
generation phase of design, and AI in design shifted from combinatorial  
searches to knowledge-based systems.  
Likewise, constraint satisfaction, which had been a strong research direc-  
tion in early design-related AI, gave way to attempts to optimize perfor-  
mance, which cannot be considered independent of form. Early work in  
this vein came to be referred to as “ performative design ” (Kolarevic and  
Malkawi 2005). A latter-day term used for what is essentially the same con-  
cept is “ performalism ” (Grobman and Neuman 2011). The ability of the  
computer to juggle and coordinate a large number of independent values  
by defining priorities and tradeoffs is exploited in such a way that the out-  
come is a balanced total. One of the prominent results of research along  
these lines is parametric design — the development of an algorithm that  
handles a large number of parameters, and the relationships among them,  
while allowing the parameters to be changed easily. Great flexibility can  
be achieved by simply tweaking the input values. Parametric design is used  
in generating form as well as in technical management of design projects,  
wherein changes in one parameter immediately lead to the updating of  
values of other, related parameters. An example of a technical applica-  
tion in architectural and construction design is BIM (Building Information  
Modeling). A BIM system takes care of necessary changes caused by altera-  
tions in specific parameters, pertaining to the form or the function of a

**Design Thinking Research 25**

building or part thereof. For example, if the bay size of the typical floor of  
an office building changes, the BIM system will update the structural plan,  
the widths of windows, and other components of the building.  
AI has many technical applications, but they are of little interest to us  
in the context of design thinking at the cognitive level. The importance  
of AI in design in this respect lies in its ability to handle more data and  
more relationships among data points than a human designer can. There-  
fore, aside from solving routine problems and consequently saving a lot of  
time and other resources, AI techniques can productively generate forms  
and combinations of forms that may be beyond the capabilities of human  
designers. In design, as in other domains, AI researchers who tried to emu-  
late human thinking based their work on imitative simulations. Another  
approach is constructive simulation (see, for example, Taura and Nagai  
2013). Researchers who employ that approach base their work primarily  
on linguistic analyses and employ semantic networks. However, the system  
is still controlled by a human designer, who retains the power to accept or  
reject the offerings of the intelligent computer.

**The Impact of Postmodernism**

Another influence on the direction of research in design that is not often  
acknowledged came from a different direction. In the 1970s, postmodern-  
ism had a huge effect not only on architectural design per se (that is, build-  
ings and their appearance) but also on a new-found interest in the process  
of designing (interest in the process of creation was, of course, not unique  
to architecture and other design fields; it was also evident in literature, in  
theater, in filmmaking, and in other fields). All of a sudden, early design  
study sketches captured the imagination of researchers and practitioners  
alike. Architectural magazines and books began to publish them, and galler-  
ies began to exhibit sketches by prominent architects and other designers,  
and also some by architects and designers who were not as well known. A  
case in point is Process in Architecture: A Documentation of Six Examples,  
an exhibition held in MIT ’ s Hayden Gallery in 1979\. In the catalog ’ s fore-  
word, Lawrence Anderson wrote:

The current surge of critical admiration for architectural drawing even includes a  
school of thought which argues that an architect’s drawings are more important  
indicators of creative intentions than are his buildings.... Here, we embrace the

**26 Chapter 2**

notion that the profession of architecture is one of problem-solving.... We hope  
that this exhibition will shed some light on this process of design.... (Anderson  
1979, 4 – 5\)

The publication of James Stirling ’ s sketches for the three German muse-  
ums he designed in the 1970s (one for D ü sseldorf, one for Cologne, and  
one for Stuttgart; only the latter was built) was quite revolutionary. Articles  
in *The Architectural Review* in 1976 and in *Lotus International* and *Architec-*  
*tural Design* in 1977 included a large number of small freehand sketches,^2  
the likes of which were not usually seen on the pages of contemporary  
publications. Before the mid 1970s it was rare indeed to find any sketches at  
all in architectural publications. Michael Wilford, who was Stirling ’ s part-  
ner at that time, explained why earlier sketches by Stirling had not been  
published: “ Prior to the German museum projects, the early exploratory  
material was considered of little value and discarded once the final design  
had been established. More recent material is stored.... ” 3 Two of the first  
studies of sketches, published by Daniel Herbert (1988, 1993), paid atten-  
tion primarily to their graphic properties. In later studies (Do and Gross  
1995; Goldschmidt 1991, 1994b; Suwa and Tversky 1997), sketching was  
investigated from a cognitive point of view in an attempt to explicate its  
contributions to design thinking and problem solving.  
Awareness of and attention to process in practice and in general cultural  
contexts, especially insofar as the creative process is concerned, coincided  
with the research agenda of cognitive science and cognitive psychology.  
This set the stage for the emergence of design thinking research, which  
was a new field of study but also the continuation of the Design Methods  
movement. It takes a confluence of social, cultural, scientific, and tech-  
nological developments to bring about profound paradigmatic changes in  
disciplines. For design research, this was the right time to move to the study  
of design thinking.

**Protocol Analysis**

According to Anders Ericsson, “ protocol analysis is a rigorous methodol-  
ogy for eliciting verbal reports of thought sequences as a valid source of  
data on thinking. ” 4 As we have no direct access to activities of the mind,  
and only limited access to brain activities that can inform us of what the  
mind is doing, the study of thought requires a mediating agent that can

**Design Thinking Research 27**

convey with fidelity elements of thought and mental manipulations. Late  
in the nineteenth century, behaviorist psychologists who were interested  
mainly in consciousness (among them John B. Watson) began to collect  
introspective self-reports and to analyze them in an attempt to establish  
what the subjects had been thinking about. But introspection was soon  
rejected because it was claimed that people cannot accurately remember  
their thoughts after the fact (at least for activities lasting longer than a few  
seconds). To overcome this problem, the “ think-aloud ” method was pio-  
neered: a subject concentrating on a well-defined task (such as solving an  
arithmetic problem) was asked to concurrently verbalize his or her thoughts.  
Real-time reports come much closer to representing thought processes than  
introspective reports do. Obviously, even a real-time report is not a com-  
plete representation of someone ’ s thinking, as some of the thoughts never  
cross the verbalization threshold. The Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker  
(1926, 1945\) was an early promoter of think-aloud studies, in which verbal-  
izations are documented in protocols and the protocols are then analyzed.  
Ill-defined and ill-structured problems are more complex than well-  
defined and well-structured ones, and thought patterns may vary signif-  
icantly among subjects. Subjects may begin by clarifying and defining a  
vague problem, and in all likelihood their thought processes are not repro-  
ducible in other, dissimilar cases. Ericsson and Simon (1984/1993) do not  
recommend the use of protocol analysis for ill-defined problems. It should  
be emphasized that design problems are often considered ill-defined,  
ill-structured, or even wicked (Buchanan 1992; Rittel and Weber 1973).  
Protocol analysis has, all the same, become a very popular research meth-  
odology in design — it is used to study typical (if singular) situations, and  
to compare processes without attempting to come up with overarching  
generalizations. In this respect, many protocol analysis studies of design  
behavior resemble the early work on thinking by Gestalt psychologists,  
which was essentially exploratory in nature. To distinguish protocol analy-  
sis based on real-time recordings from other varieties of protocol analysis  
(such as retrospective protocol analysis, discussed below), it is sometimes  
called “ concurrent protocol analysis. ”  
A few decades after the dispersion of the Gestalt group in Germany,  
the issue of accessing mental processes was again in vogue because of the  
interest in high-level cognitive processes spurred by the cognitive revolu-  
tion of the 1960s. Capturing think-aloud verbalizations and other real-time

**28 Chapter 2**

verbalizations became much easier with the advent of the tape recorder  
in 1945\. Not long thereafter, it became possible to transcribe recordings  
directly to a computer, which could then process them in various ways.  
In one well-known early study of thinking based on the analysis of think-  
aloud protocols, Adriann de Groot (1965/1978) reconstructed the “ search  
trees ” of novice and expert chess players. Subsequent studies centered on  
domain-specific problem solving in various disciplines, including design.  
The first study of such problem solving in design was done by Charles  
Eastman (1970). Ö mer Akin, Eastman ’ s colleague at Carnegie Mellon Uni-  
versity, published the first study based on think-aloud recordings that  
was specific to architectural design (Akin 1978). As has been mentioned,  
Carnegie Mellon was a major center of cognition-related research in that  
period, and it was there that the first decisive volume on protocol analy-  
sis was written (Ericsson and Simon 1984/1993). The revised edition, pub-  
lished in 1993, is the most authoritative text on protocol analysis yet to  
have been published. Another comprehensive monograph on the topic was  
published by van Someren et al. in 1994\.  
The validity of verbalizations by individuals who are asked to “ think  
out loud ” (not a habitual behavior) was questioned. The claim was that  
the need to verbalize one ’ s thoughts must affect the thinking processes.  
However, Ericsson and Simon (1984/1993) found that after a little training  
subjects ’ sequences of thoughts were not altered when they thought aloud.  
The training is meant to ensure that subjects do not focus on describing  
or explaining their thoughts, which requires extra (cognitive) attention to  
such descriptions or explanations. Instead, subjects are asked to simply give  
voice to their natural thoughts. The line between the two is not sharp.  
When subjects tend to be too self-conscious, they may engage in describ-  
ing, which may well affect their design behavior (Davies 1995). Some sub-  
jects take somewhat longer to complete a task when thinking out loud,  
but if duration is of no relevance this is inconsequential. In rare cases par-  
ticipants in think-aloud experiments report that they are not comfortable  
verbalizing their thoughts and that having to do so affects their thinking.  
There are also individual differences in verbalization skills among partici-  
pants, and these differences have to be taken into account in the choice of  
participants (van Someren et al. 1994).  
Although verbal data cannot be a complete representation of think-  
ing, they are now recognized as “ second best ” in that they allow access to  
information that cannot be obtained in any other way. Therefore, protocol

**Design Thinking Research 29**

analysis has become a powerful, frequently used research methodology in  
cognitive psychology, in cognitive science, and in other disciplines.  
In design, studies of problem solving are not limited to individuals. Mem-  
bers of a small team often work together to produce and develop design  
ideas. In teamwork the concern regarding the validity of verbalizations is  
irrelevant, as a team ’ s members naturally communicate verbally with one  
another as they work together and therefore a recording of the conversation  
is an authentic verbal output of real-time thinking (to the extent that talk-  
ing reflects thinking). In many recent studies of design behavior and think-  
ing, conversations of members of two-person, three-person, four-person, or  
five-person teams were recorded to produce analyzable protocols. Despite  
differences, the verbal records of individuals and teams are comparable and  
can be analyzed in the same way. In fact, the individual ’ s reasoning can be  
compared to that of a team — “ the individual designer is a unitary system  
that resembles a team ” (Goldschmidt 1995, 209). A specific issue that arises  
in the case of design (and sometimes in other endeavors too) is that some of  
the communication, or the thinking in the case of individuals, is not verbal  
but graphic. Designers are in the habit of sketching as they work on design  
problems or as they discuss them. Informal sketches that do not use a fixed  
set of (formal) symbols can convey design ideas at all levels of articulation,  
and when designers engage in sketching they do not always accompany  
their sketches with words. This may make it difficult to analyze the verbal  
data, as they may contain “ gaps ” in which sketches substitute for words —  
especially if the researcher was not present during the design session. For  
this reason, video recordings rather than voice recordings are often used, as  
they capture sketching (as well as gestures and other non-verbal behaviors).  
To date there is no effective method for analyzing sketches that accompany  
verbal reports, but they are used to clarify verbalizations that are not suf-  
ficiently comprehensible otherwise.

**Parsing protocols**  
Protocols are transcripts of recorded verbalizations by subjects engaged  
in problem solving or in some other activity the thought processes of  
which one wishes to capture. A complete and unedited transcript provides  
raw data for a study. To be analyzed, a protocol is parsed into utterances  
(small segments of speech). What these segments are depends on the  
nature of the study and the length of the protocol. Sometimes a segment  
is time-based — for example, three minutes of recorded speech. Often every

**30 Chapter 2**

sentence (where a sentence is understood to end with a full stop) consists  
of one segment. When a protocol records teamwork, the unit may be based  
on turn taking in speech: one member ’ s verbalization ends when another  
member takes over. This may result in uneven units, since some verbaliza-  
tions may be much longer than others.  
Sometimes the unit of analysis departs from the direct utterances,  
although it is based on them. For example, a unit could be an idea, or a  
decision. In this case the researcher interprets the protocol and infers ideas  
or concepts from it. Then the consecutive ideas that are raised in the session  
become the units of analysis. This is particularly relevant for teamwork and  
for studies that center on idea generation. For studies that pertain to deci-  
sion making, decisions may be inferred from the protocol. In design think-  
ing research the most common unit of analysis is the *design move* , a small  
unit of verbalization lasting a few seconds.

**Coding**  
Once a protocol has been parsed into its constituent or inferred units  
of analysis, protocol analysis calls for the establishment of a scheme of  
categories according to which the segments are to be encoded. A scheme  
of categories based on the theoretical model that drives the study and its  
specific goals is created. Categories must be well related to the particulars of  
the case in question (Ericsson and Simon 1984/1993). The number of cat-  
egories is important, mainly because it is hard to reach meaningful conclu-  
sions with too many categories (and subcategories) but also because a large  
number of categories makes coding difficult and unreliable. A good way to  
reach the right balance between fidelity and the number of categories is to  
start with a larger set of categories and then use trial and error to reduce  
their number. Categories with very few encoded units may be discarded or  
merged with related categories. Ericsson and Simon (1993) report a study  
that benefited from a reduction of the number of categories from 30 to 15\.  
This is an important point that many researchers overlook, which leads to  
fragmented results that fail to deliver a coherent picture, as there are too  
many categories.  
The nature of categories is most important, and, like the nature of the  
unit of analysis (move, idea, time-based unit, etc.), it depends on the goals  
of the study. In design, some general and seemingly generic schemes have

**Design Thinking Research 31**

been suggested, among them clarifying the task, searching for concepts,  
and fixing the concept (G ü nther et al. 1996). Such schemes have also been  
called “ process oriented. ” The best-known and best-developed attempt  
to offer a generic categorization scheme that is claimed to be valid across  
design domains and design tasks was proposed by John Gero (see, e.g., Gero  
and Kannengiesser 2011; Purcell et al. 1996). The scheme consists of three  
main categories: function, behavior, and structure. Together these catego-  
ries are referred to as the *FBS ontology* (see chapter 7). The categories are  
defined as follows (Gero and Kannengiesser 2011, 370):

The *Function* (F) of an artifact is its teleology ( “ what the artifact is for ” ).

The *Behavior* (B) of an artifact is the attributes that can be derived from its  
structure ( “ what the artifact does ” ).

The *Structure* (S) of an artifact is its components and their relationships  
( “ what the artifact consists of ” ).

The aspired-to generic scheme of categories is meant to fill the hith-  
erto unmet need to standardize research methods in design and to make it  
easier to compare and relate results obtained by different researchers across  
cases. However, most researchers prefer categories tailored to their goals  
and to the specific cases they investigate, and such categories yield context-  
oriented schemes. In line with Ericsson and Simon ’ s (1984/1993) recom-  
mendations, it is also possible to analyze the same protocol using multiple  
schemes of categories. For example, G ü nther et al. (1996) devised a second  
scheme for a task of designing a bicycle rack to hold a backpack. Whereas  
the first scheme of clarifying the task, searching for concepts, and fixing  
the concept was rather abstract, the second scheme was content oriented  
and task specific. The categories of the second scheme were the bicycle, the  
backpack, the position of the rack, joining the pack to the rack, joining the  
rack to the bicycle, and the rack ’ s structure. Obviously the two schemes are  
very different. They are devised for different purposes, and, since they are  
orthogonal to one other, no comparison is possible.  
Reliability is essential in coding, especially when the number of cat-  
egories is large. It is, therefore, important to employ more than one coder  
and to check inter-coder reliability. In addition, it may be necessary to  
establish a mechanism for “ arbitration ” in cases of disagreement. Unfor-  
tunately, many of the published protocol analysis studies in design report

**32 Chapter 2**

coding by a single coder, and therefore the reliability of the results is not  
guaranteed.

**Analysis**  
In analyzing parsed and coded protocols it is possible to cut through the  
data in several ways, but one always obtains frequency patterns of the vari-  
ous types of verbalization that were recorded. Progression in time and par-  
ticular sequences of categories may be deduced. Fixation, major concepts  
and patterns of collaboration, and role playing in teams are some of the  
issues that may be elucidated by analyzing protocols. Joachim G ü nther  
et al. (1996), for example, compared the processes of the individual designer  
and the team in the Delft protocols (which were produced for the Delft  
protocol workshop) on the basis of the proportion of time devoted to each  
activity category. They also compared the three designers in the team in  
terms of their contribution to the discussion per category of activity. They  
emphasized that what they could not do in this research was answer “ why ”  
questions, because the analysis of the data does not explain the observed  
design behavior.  
Masaki Suwa and his associates (Suwa and Tversky 1997; Suwa et al.

1998. conducted a number of very detailed protocol studies that focused  
      on designers ’ cognitive processes, especially in relation to acts of sketching.  
      The units of analysis were design moves. In Suwa et al. 1998 the categories  
      were types of actions; the four main categories described physical, percep-  
      tual, functional, and conceptual actions (which correspond to cognitive  
      levels of information processing). Physical and conceptual actions were fur-  
      ther subdivided into three subcategories each. Additional breakdowns of  
      the categories yielded a detailed coding scheme that was subjected to mac-  
      roanalysis and microanalysis. The latter was aimed at devising a taxonomy  
      of primitives that may shed light on designers ’ cognitive actions. Accord-  
      ing to the authors, these studies illustrated that the primitives of cognitive  
      design actions can be established (microanalysis) and that sketches serve as  
      an extended external memory that the designer can use later in the design  
      process.  
      Suwa et al. (ibid.) pointed out some of the predicaments they encoun-  
      tered, including the fact that it is difficult to encode segments (moves)  
      that seem ambiguous and the fact that discontinuities in speech, espe-  
      cially while sketching, may lead to multiple interpretations of concurrent

**Design Thinking Research 33**

cognitive actions (that is, to uncertainty about sketching acts). The meth-  
odology used in both studies by Suwa and associates was retrospective  
protocol analysis. The designer was videotaped, was later shown the video  
recording, and was asked to comment on his or her intentions and actions.

**Limitations**  
Alongside obvious advantages, protocol analysis has weaknesses that must  
be recognized:

*Incomplete reflection of thinking processes* Although think-aloud records  
come closer to reflecting actual thinking processes than introspective  
reports or observations, which are much more prone to interpretation (or  
misinterpretation) by researchers, we cannot expect concurrent verbaliza-  
tions to be a perfect reflection of thinking, especially in team sessions but  
also in individual episodes. I adopt a Vygotskian view on the relationship  
between thought and speech. Lev Vygotsky (1986) distinguished between  
two planes of speech: inner and external. Inner speech is not a pre-  
linguistic form of reasoning but the semantic aspect of speech, abbreviated  
speech, in that it centers on predication and tends to omit the subject of  
a sentence and words connected to it. Inner speech is a function in itself,  
not an aspect of external speech; inner and external speech together form  
a *unity* of speech. Thinking aloud can be seen as close to inner speech,  
whereas a conversation is certainly a sample of external speech. Both inner  
and external speech are, however, more than representations of thought. In  
Vygotsky ’ s words: “ Thought is not merely expressed in words; it comes into  
existence through them. ” (ibid., 218\)

*Possible interference with normal thinking patterns* This is hard to demon-  
strate. Ericsson and Simon (1984/1993) reported no interference in the nor-  
mal thought processes of individuals who were asked to think aloud after a  
short training session. However, some studies claim that some interference  
may occur, at least in some subjects.

*Protocol analysis is labor intensive* Parsing and encoding protocols is labor  
intensive, even when researchers are experienced. If the unit of analysis is  
about 7 seconds long, as was found in several studies, a one-hour protocol  
should include more than 500 units (segments; moves). Therefore, long  
design episodes are difficult to analyze at the cognitive level. However, it  
is possible to use larger or extracted units, which permits analysis of longer

**34 Chapter 2**

sessions. Of course, there are also situations (for example, dispersed teams  
and work in intervals in multiple locations) that make it impractical to  
attempt proper audio or video recording (in both of the aforementioned  
cases, a limited number of protocols are usually collected for any single  
study, and for that reason findings are hard to generalize).

*Delimiting the analysis unit* When people think aloud without explain-  
ing their thoughts, their verbalizations are often incomplete, repetitive, or  
incoherent. This can make it difficult to decide what constitutes a unit of  
analysis and difficult to interpret it. Because there are no standard rules  
of parsing, it is hard to compare studies. In addition, it is hard to decide  
what should be left out of a protocol — for example, verbalizations such as  
“ oh ” and “ yeah, ” other single words, incoherent statements, and seemingly  
unrelated or loosely related verbalizations.

*Inter-coder reliability* As was mentioned earlier, reaching acceptable values  
of inter-coder reliability in protocol studies is no trivial matter. In better  
cases it is time consuming for coders to engage in deliberations meant to  
achieve agreement on codes; in worse cases the analysis is based on encod-  
ings by a single coder. This point is closely connected to the next one.

*Ambiguity in verbalization* One reason it is hard to achieve sufficient agree-  
ment among coders is that often verbalizations pertain to a number of top-  
ics in an intertwined manner and it is hard to decide how to categorize  
them. In addition, as was pointed out earlier, coders encounter verbaliza-  
tions that are difficult to make sense of, and they have to rely on their own  
interpretations (which are sometimes quite speculative); this leads to differ-  
ences among codings and even among the codes used by the same coder in  
different instances.

These limitations are not as severe as they may sound. If one accepts the  
fact that protocol analysis has limitations, and uses it only for what it is  
useful for, then the most important thing to do is maintain inter-analysis  
and intra-analysis consistency. This ensures that, even though the studies  
are not without shortcomings and limitations, they can arrive at reliable  
findings and solid conclusions.

**Related Research Methods**  
Although I have suggested that concurrent protocol analysis is the best  
methodology available today for the study of design thinking at the

**Design Thinking Research 35**

cognitive level, a number of other methodologies that are in use in design  
thinking research should be acknowledged.

*Retrospective protocol analysis* In retrospective protocol analysis, subjects  
are asked to solve a problem as they normally would but are not necessarily  
asked to think aloud. Later (but as close as possible to the session in ques-  
tion) the video recording is shown to the subject, who is asked to comment  
on his or her thinking. Usually most of the comments refer to important  
events in the process, so researchers are able to track the important deci-  
sions (including those that were later abandoned). Often a researcher gets  
good documentation of the final solution and how it was achieved, but this  
method is less valid if one is interested in the moment-to-moment evolu-  
tion of the subject ’ s thinking. A version of retrospective protocol analy-  
sis that emphasizes explicit explanations of design acts that designers are  
required to provide in the viewing session was used by Taura and Nagai  
(2013), who called their method “ extended protocol analysis. ” Their aim  
was to use semantic network techniques to calculate the expansion of the  
designer ’ s “ thought space. ” Sometimes retrospective protocol analysis is  
chosen because it is less labor intensive and can therefore be used to ana-  
lyze somewhat longer sessions. Per Galle and L á szl ó Kov á cs (1996) devised  
“ replication protocol analysis, ” a method for the analysis of real-world  
design events. Their deliberate purpose was to capture not what transpired  
on the fly, but the “ post hoc rationalization ” of the design. Their method  
called for the reconstruction of a design process, from the given program to  
the final solution, by a trained designer who was not involved in the  
case. The result of such a reconstruction is a series of arguments that lead  
from the requirements to the solution. This may be repeated with more  
“ replicators ” to provide the most credible course of reasoning. Galle and  
Kov á cs applied replication protocol analysis to an entry in an architec-  
tural competition and claimed that the analysis yielded many insights into  
design reasoning. They concluded that the method is particularly handy  
for lengthy processes wherein it is impractical to apply protocol analysis. I  
accept the claims but continue to argue that the major problem of fidelity  
to real thought processes, if those are the object of inquiry, is not solved in  
retrospective protocol analysis of any kind.

*Interviews* Another method that yields deliberate post hoc information  
about design processes and design reasoning is interviewing designers

**36 Chapter 2**

(see, e.g., Lawson 1994). It is, of course, useful to learn how designers  
regard their own processes, but the fidelity problem looms heavily in  
the case of interviews: even the most conscientious of designers is likely  
to tell a story of how he or she wished to have designed. Interviews are  
useful in biographical accounts. The short and focused interviews that are  
sometimes conducted right after a think-aloud exercise, known as “ debrief-  
ings, ” are useful for elucidating protocol passages that otherwise would be  
unclear.

*Observation* Where the interpretation of behavior is the major goal of  
a study, observing problem solvers at work is an appropriate method.  
In design research, observation is a useful method — particularly in real-  
life situations such as design teams in industry and when the goal is  
to describe meta-behavior, sequences of activities, or allocation of roles.  
In a well-known study in this category, Eckart Frankenberger and Petra  
Badke-Schaub (1998) observed an engineering team as it performed a  
design task.

*Gestures* Studying gestures is a recent addition to research methods in  
design. A major motivation is that gestures accompany and augment ver-  
balizations in design, and sometimes substitute for speech or sketching. If  
we could interpret them accurately, we might gain access to thinking that is  
not externalized, or to inner speech. Gestures may be most relevant to the  
study of social aspects of team interactions in design sessions, where body-  
language may turn out to be quite revealing. Willemien Visser and Mary  
Lou Maher (2011, 219\) predicted that a good understanding of the role of  
gestures in design thinking would affect “ how we support and augment  
designers using computational systems. ”

*Eye tracking* Eye tracking, a long-established research methodology in psy-  
chology, is used mainly to study attention and perception. One motivation  
for employing it is a desire to study the psychology and pedagogy of read-  
ing and practical issues of human factors — for example, how to optimize  
the design of an airplane ’ s dashboard. There are also many commercial  
implications, from developing guidelines for the arrangement of products  
on the shelf in the supermarket to designing Web pages. The latter has  
become a proliferous research topic in Web usability (Jacob and Karn 2003).  
Other than in Web usability, however, eye tracking is not a commonly used  
methodology in design research.

**The Suitability of Protocol Analysis**

Far more than any other methodology, concurrent protocol analysis has  
established itself as a major research methodology in design thinking. If  
carried out meticulously, protocol analysis is reliable and useful. It entails  
subjects verbalizing their thoughts with no attempt to provide superfluous  
explanations, and parsing and coding “ by the book ” (optimally by three  
parsers and three coders, with high inter-coder agreement). Under these  
conditions we gain high-fidelity access to thought processes and sequences  
that are not otherwise accessible. The methodology is especially suited for  
investigating the solving of well-defined problems. In the case of ill-defined  
problems, such as design tasks, it is not as easy to arrive at generalizable  
results. All the same, protocol analysis has been recognized as sufficiently  
promising to warrant a special workshop (see chapter 1). The workshop  
was convened in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft  
University of Technology in 1994 (see appendix), and the papers presented  
were turned into an influential book (Cross et al. 1996).  
Among the most important lessons learned from this concentrated effort  
was that protocol analysis is not well suited for long episodes. The Delft  
task lasted two hours (already quite long), but most design tasks take much  
longer, and it is not practical to attempt to record think-aloud sessions or  
even team sessions in the whole course of a design task. Therefore, it must  
be clearly understood that protocol analysis as a research methodology is  
limited to short stretches of time — not more than a few hours (unless one  
uses sizable segments or derived entities such as ideas or decisions as the  
units of analysis). Luckily, no long stretches are required for the study of  
cognitive processes, and a sufficient number of data points can be obtained  
in a relatively short time since the unit of analysis is small. Therefore, if the  
goal is to explore design thinking from the cognitive viewpoint, protocol  
analysis is a suitable methodology.

## 3 Design Synthesis

**The Front End of the Design Process**

From the cognitive perspective, the design phase of the greatest interest  
is the early, preliminary phase — the “ front edge. ” Because most design  
problems are ill-structured and ill-defined (Simon 1973), the early phase  
of designing is when designers have to come to terms with the task — that  
is, interpret it, frame it, and reframe it (Sch ö n 1984\) until it is sufficiently  
coherent to generate solution ideas. The process of clarification and fram-  
ing and the process of searching for a solution are not sequential; rather,  
they occur in parallel (Dorst and Cross 2001). We talk about a search for  
a solution that takes place within a space: problem solving in general has  
been described as occurring within a problem space and a solution space  
(e.g., Reitman 1964; Simon 1973), with a difference between well-structured  
and ill-structured problems (Goel 1995). Dorst and Cross (2001) proposed,  
for design, the co-evolution of problems and solutions in what may be seen  
as a unified problem/solution space. Specific to design, the term “ design  
space ” has been adapted from artificial intelligence (see, e.g., Woodbury  
and Burrow 2006), and Coyne et al. (1990) have claimed that “ spaces of  
designs ” can be defined by abduction. In its current interpretation it is less  
formal and akin to what Sch ö n (1983) called a “ design world. ” A design  
world or space encompasses, among other things, prevailing cultural and  
professional norms, the designer ’ s personal values, his or her repertoire of  
solutions and professional skills, and the context in which the task is set.  
The search at the front end of designing is seen as taking place within a  
design space in which the designer experiments, makes propositions, tests,  
evaluates, compares alternatives, asks questions, and raises doubts — all with  
the aim of achieving a coherent construal of the problem and a satisficing

**40 Chapter 3**

(to use Simon ’ s term) solution that is explainable and justifiable. It has to  
be justifiable because the proposed solution is always one of at least several  
possible design solutions. When presenting a design proposal (solution),  
one always has to explain why this is the best possible choice under the  
circumstances. That is, a design always comes with a rationale for its par-  
ticular features.  
The importance of the front edge of designing is in the idea-generating  
process that takes place in it, usually in an intensive manner, in either a  
highly structured process or with designers having free rein. At the end of  
this phase a solution-in-principle is achieved (sometimes called a “ parti, ”  
especially in architectural design), which is then further developed and  
articulated, until ultimately the designed entity can be fully specified and  
thereby ready for implementation (construction, production, manufactur-  
ing, assembly). Good ideas at the front edge will lead to a successful result,  
whereas ideas of lesser quality may well result in less successful outcomes.  
In terms of resource investment (time, money) the conceptual front edge,  
which is relatively short and often involves a small number of designers  
(and others), incurs only a small fraction of the overall design costs, while  
subsequent phases are much costlier, irrespective of the quality of the ini-  
tial ideas. Therefore it is of crucial importance that the search at the front  
edge should yield the best possible ideas. What are good, leave alone best,  
ideas? This is a philosophical question of some magnitude that I shall not  
endeavor to treat here in depth. All the same, based on common practice,  
it is possible to assert that a work of design is usually considered success-  
ful if it is novel (in industrial products, this is often a technologically ori-  
ented criterion), even surprising; meets requirements and needs, whether  
or not such needs were pre-specified (certain innovative designs even create  
needs, such as the first iPhone); comes with a reasonable price tag; is easy  
to create, use and safely dispose of; and last but not least, is attractive and  
appealing to potential users.  
Now that the importance of the early stage of the design process is evi-  
dent, it is clear why we are interested in researching it, and in particular the  
thinking that is discernible at this stage. As we saw in the previous chapter,  
a relatively recent yet keen interest in what may be termed design think-  
ing or design cognition has led researchers to concentrate less on meth-  
ods and more on an attempt to comprehend modes of design thinking,  
sometimes referred to as design behavior (although thinking is only part of

**Design Synthesis 41**

behavior). Indeed, the principal themes in the major journal *Design Stud-*  
*ies* between 1996 and 2010 were found to be “ design process ” and “ design  
cognition ” (Chai and Xiao 2012; Cross 2010). The purpose of such research  
is to find out how designers think, how they learn to think in “ designerly ”  
ways (Cross 2006\) and acquire design expertise, and what distinguishes the  
thinking of good designers from that of less accomplished or proficient  
designers. In other words, which traits of thinking are likely to yield bet-  
ter design outcomes, and can they be taught, enhanced, and supported? A  
lot of questions may be posed such as: how does a design stage in which  
a breakthrough is achieved compare to a stage wherein no breakthrough  
or even no progress is attained? What thought patterns distinguish an  
expert from a novice designer? How does visual thinking and the mak-  
ing of sketches aid thinking processes? Are certain design thinking patterns  
indicative of creativity? Obviously, this is a non-exhaustive list of research  
issues. The research methodology of protocol analysis comes in handy in  
answering such questions. As has already been mentioned, despite limita-  
tions it provides better access to thought processes than other methods at  
our disposal and this is why protocol analysis has become the principle  
methodology of design thinking research (Chai and Xiao 2012).

**Design Moves**

Cognitive psychology and the research traditions in the behavioral sciences  
teach us that in order to understand design thinking, like any thinking, we  
should concentrate on small increments of thought. This means abandon-  
ing sweeping “ comprehensive ” models such as the “ spiral model ” of design  
(see figure 2.2). The models advanced by earlier “ design methods ” were  
linear, even if the linear progression was curved into a spiral and included  
iterations and repetitions of certain stages. The deep underlying premise  
of those models was that the design process comprises separate phases and  
designers progress from one phase to another, with backtracking where it is  
necessary. Our new understanding of the process leaves behind the linear  
model. Regardless of design phases, which no doubt exist but which teach  
us little about thinking, the premise now is that one must look at small  
segments of the process in order to understand thinking characteristics.  
For most researchers protocol analysis is a most suitable method to explore  
these small segments.^1

**42 Chapter 3**

Design protocols are generated and parsed into segments like any other  
protocols. Unlike some other protocols, they are often accompanied by  
sketches that are used primarily to interpret verbalizations. As we have  
seen, parsing may be time-based (e.g., three minutes of verbal output), or  
semantically based (e.g., one sentence), or they may be based on units of  
content that comprise one sentence, part of a sentence, or more than one  
sentence; in teamwork, turn taking is also a common parsing principle.  
In the content-based category we find definitions of analysis units such  
as step, action, movement, or move. What “ move ” connotes is akin to its  
meaning in chess: a step in the process that changes the situation. There  
is some agreement on the use of this term (e.g., Dillon 2010; Goldschmidt  
1995; Suwa et al. 1998), although this definition does not match Sch ö n ’ s  
use of the term “ design move ” (Sch ö n 1992). In his interpretation a move  
is an act, rather close to a decision, made between acts of seeing; in this  
view the design process is composed of cycles of seeing, moving, and see-  
ing. Here a more general view of a design move is upheld, whereby a design  
move is a step, an act, an operation, that transforms the design situation  
somewhat relative to the state it was in before that move (Goldschmidt  
1995). Seeing can therefore be a design move, if we can capture it through  
the designer ’ s verbalization in think-aloud documentation. Moves are nor-  
mally small steps, discernible from their contents, and with some training  
it is not difficult to reach agreement and consistency in parsing a proto-  
col into moves and deciding which utterances are meaningless and should  
not be designated as moves ( “ yeah, ” “ OK, ” “ emm, ” and so on); such utter-  
ances are removed from the analysis. David Botta and Robert Woodbury  
(2013) point out that the term “ conversational move, ” coined by Paul Grice  
(1975), carries an evocative similarity to the term design move, as a design  
protocol can be seen as a record of a conversation among designers or of a  
designer with himself or herself.  
Several studies concluded that the average duration of a move in a design  
session is about 7 seconds (Baya 1996; Baya and Leifer 1966; Goldschmidt  
2012; Kan and Gero 2008; Andrew Milne, personal communications^2 ).  
Moves generated in teamwork are shorter. However, if we use the concept  
of move as the basic unit of analysis and not a time-based unit, we should  
bear in mind that moves vary in length and duration.  
The following example is a short vignette from a protocol derived from  
a recording of an architect named Martin, who was thinking aloud while

**Design Synthesis 43**

working on the design of a small library (see the appendix). It is parsed into  
three moves, which in this case correspond to sentences:

We start creating a hierarchy: the large trees, the parking lots, the pedestrians, an  
entry axis.

I would then look for a direct relationship between entrance and exterior, because  
here, the real edge is not this \[edge of building\], for me it ’ s that \[edge of site\].

I would try to have an important element; would therefore make the axis I men-  
tioned before, this one \[points to sketch\].

Moves are not the smallest possible units of analysis. A move may be  
parsed into its constituent arguments, which are the smallest semantic  
units that hold a comprehensible concept. For example, the third move  
in Martin ’ s utterance above is composed of two arguments. The first argu-  
ment states that the designer would like to introduce an important ele-  
ment, without specifying what kind of element that could be; the second  
argument specifies the important element in terms of an architectural fea-  
ture, in this case an axis:

I would try to have an important element.

Ι would therefore make the axis I mentioned before, this one.

For certain purposes it is of interest to analyze protocols using arguments  
as the basic units. This was done to investigate the relationship between  
embodiment and rationale in design thinking (Goldschmidt 2001, 2012),  
where embodiment denotes physical properties of a design element or com-  
ponent and rationale the reason for selecting or desiring certain properties.  
These two modes of reasoning are the scheme of categories by which the  
arguments are encoded. However, more often we want to concentrate on  
larger units: the move, or, in some cases, derived units such as ideas or deci-  
sions that are more complete and are stand-alone units.  
The difficulty in establishing appropriate universal schemes of catego-  
ries for protocol analysis in design, which was discussed in chapter 2, is  
not surprising. Design tasks differ greatly in nature and scope, resulting in  
diverse foci, and accordingly designers must attend to changing aspects  
of the design task. As a result, attention may be directed to form or to  
function, to the whole or the details, to technological issues, to ergonomic  
considerations or aesthetic values, and so on. Within a single task, too,  
different phases may require different approaches. Personal dispositions of

**44 Chapter 3**

designers also affect what they choose to tend to and determine their pri-  
orities. In addition, the purpose of each study of the process of design is  
different. Consequently, it is hardly possible to develop a single scheme of  
analysis categories that would be useful across the board for protocol stud-  
ies in design. When I first began to use protocol analysis, I experimented  
with schemes of categories but was disappointed with the results. Not only  
did no assurance surface that the categories were appropriate, but the sig-  
nificance of the findings (which indicated what kind of design activities  
were carried out, what the relationships among them were, and when they  
occurred) was not satisfactory. Findings of this sort are, of course, impor-  
tant for some purposes, especially when they are used to compare perfor-  
mances of different populations — for example, experts vs. novices — on the  
same task. Comparisons are of the essence in protocol analysis of any kind.  
However, categorizing design activities was not helpful when the goal was  
to fathom thinking processes.  
The feeling that coding-based protocol analysis was too case specific,  
and the uncertainty about what could be learned from these analyses that  
would have some general validity, led to the question whether design pro-  
tocols could not be analyzed in a different way. Our interest was clearly  
in design cognition and not in kinds of design acts, which were taken to  
be contingent on the task, the phase, and the designer ’ s priorities. Experi-  
ence as a designer and as a teacher in dozens of design studios of vary-  
ing standing led to the conclusion that the most crucial thing in a design  
process is the solidification of a major idea, or combination of ideas, that  
could bring together all the major aspects the design had to respond to.  
In other words, synthesis, or integration, was the major goal of concep-  
tual design. As Christopher Alexander pointed out so eloquently, even  
the simplest of design tasks is complex and necessitates an integration of  
responses to many requirements and desires, which may even be conflict-  
ing (for example, advanced technology and high-quality materials versus  
low cost). Alexander (1964) talked about a “ good fit ” that must be achieved  
among design components by resolving “ misfits. ” John Archea (1987)  
used the metaphor of “ puzzle making ” to describe how architects achieve  
a unified whole by fitting discrete pieces together. Arriving at a state of  
good fit is no trivial matter; indeed, it has long been considered a mystery,  
magic, a manifestation of creativity that cannot (and some thought should  
not) be explained. Alexander, Archea, and some other researchers thought

**Design Synthesis 45**

otherwise, of course; so did some of the psychologists who began to unveil  
creative processes.  
On the view that design processes are not a matter of magic and that the  
thought processes that underlie them must be explicable in terms of think-  
ing in general, a way was sought to analyze design protocols that would  
reveal something about the thinking involved, regardless of the specific  
design domain or task. It was clear that the analysis would have to be based  
on very small segments that mapped well onto design moves. This hap-  
pened at precisely the time when the design research community began to  
direct its attention to design thinking, and psychological concepts gained a  
foothold in the explorations that researchers began to undertake. The con-  
comitance of two modes of thinking and reasoning is one of these concepts.

**Two Modes of Thought**

Several psychologists subscribe to the view that we use two systems of  
reasoning — indeed two modes of thought — in everyday life, and that the  
balance between them is particularly pertinent to the understanding of  
creative thought. Different authors have used different terms to describe  
the two systems. Steven Sloman (1996) described an associative, similarity-  
based system versus a symbolic, rule-based one. The associative system  
makes use of visual representations when they are relevant, and design is  
a case in point; the rule-based system specifies a rationale. In chess, for  
example, there is evidence that pattern recognition and rational “ forward  
search ” are deeply entangled (Linhares et al. 2012); this may suggest a  
similar entanglement of systems in other instances of problem-solving  
thinking, such as designing. Liane Gabora (2010, 2\) talked about associa-  
tive thought and analytic thought; the former tends to be intuitive and  
“ conducive to unearthing remote or subtle associations between items that  
share features or are correlated but not necessarily causally related. ” “ This, ”  
Gabora continued, “ may lead to a promising idea or solution, although  
perhaps in a vague, unpolished form. ” In contrast, analytic thought is rule  
based and convergent, and is “ conducive to analyzing relationships of cause  
and effect between items already believed to be related ” (ibid., 3). Recently  
Daniel Kahneman, whose interest in decision making is well known,  
published a book ( *Thinking, Fast and Slow* ) in which he argued that fast  
thinking is mostly intuitive and based on memory and emotion, whereas

**46 Chapter 3**

slow thinking is rational and entails calculating consequences. All these  
descriptions may be seen as roughly corresponding to *divergent thought* and  
*convergent thought*. These terms have been used by creativity researchers,  
with a pronounced emphasis on divergent thought, which was seen as the  
hallmark of creative thinking (see, e.g., Finke et al. 1992; Mednick 1962).  
Divergent thinking is defined as “ thinking that moves away in diverging  
directions so as to involve a variety of aspects and which sometimes leads  
to novel ideas and solutions; associated with creativity. ” Convergent think-  
ing is demarcated as “ thinking that brings together information focused on  
solving a problem (especially solving problems that have a single correct  
solution). ” 3 There is much more literature on divergent thinking than on  
convergent thinking.  
Today there is evidence that creative thinking involves both divergent  
and convergent thought. Gabora (2010), who gave a neurological account  
of creative thought in terms of memory activation, suggested that divergent  
thought is associated with defocused attention and convergent thought is  
related to focused attention, and that these two types of attention give rise  
to different memory activation patterns (that is, different patterns of con-  
nections among neurons in the brain). Gabora asserted that creative think-  
ing requires the flexibility to shift between the two modes of thinking. In  
her words, “ creativity involves the ability to either shrink or expand the  
field of attention, and thereby match where one ’ s mode of thought lies on  
the spectrum from associative to analytic according to the situation one  
is in ” (ibid., 3). Min Basadur (1995) used the words “ ideation ” and “ eval-  
uation ” to describe the scope of the spectrum to which Gabora referred,  
and related them to divergent and convergent thinking. These research-  
ers emphasized that the two modes of thought complement one another,  
and that shifts between them are frequent. According to Paul Howard-Jones  
and Steve Murray (2003), in creative thought these modes of thought serve  
to ensure originality (divergent thought) and appropriateness (convergent  
thought).  
Design must perforce be seen as a creative activity, in that one brings  
into being a representation of an entity that does not yet exist. Design  
thinking and reasoning is therefore a typical case of creative thinking, and  
we can now talk about the synthesis that is to be achieved during the early  
phase of the design process as a series of cycles of divergent and conver-  
gent thinking (or any of the related terms used in the relevant literature)

**Design Synthesis 47**

in which ideation and evaluation follow each other in frequent proximity,  
pertaining to embodiment and rationale. This notion is in line with the  
agreement that design is not a linear process, which may in itself imply  
more than one mode of thinking. We shall revisit the important concept  
of divergent and convergent thinking and reasoning in chapter 6, which  
focuses on design creativity.  
We can now go back to design moves, which are obviously not generated  
in isolation but which relate to one another in various ways. It is proposed  
that revealing the links among design moves is the key to understanding  
the dual modes of design thinking and arrival at a design synthesis. This is  
the case because “ effective reasoning in a creative endeavor must perforce  
aim at first mining and then relating to one another the many items of data  
that are relevant to the task ” (Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005, 595).

**Design Synthesis as Backlinks and Forelinks among Moves**

Design moves are brief acts of thinking, lasting around seven seconds. They  
are generated sequentially in time. Taken together, they express the design  
thinking process. Since moves are not generated as autonomous entities,  
they form continuums of various lengths in which they are interrelated, or  
linked. The pattern of links is neither known in advance nor fixed in any  
way, but it can be established empirically for each sequence of moves. How  
can we determine links among moves?  
Links are based on the contents of moves. Deciding whether two moves  
are linked is done by using common sense under the condition of good  
acquaintance with the discipline and with the design episode in question.  
Acquaintance is essential to ensure that the person who judges whether  
or not a link exists understands precisely what the designer was doing, or  
thinking, despite difficulties that can arise in deciphering think-aloud docu-  
mentation, for example, repetitions, jargon, incomplete sentences, unclear  
speech, and use of “ this, ” “ that, ” “ here, ” “ there, ” and similar words when  
referring to representations such as sketches or other objects that were  
present in the work environment. Video recordings and copies of sketches  
help in interpreting such utterances but do not always aid in making sense  
of incomplete or unclear sentences. However, a sufficiently experienced  
observer in the relevant field of design who followed the design session  
carefully can, upon reading the (parsed) protocol several times, use what

**48 Chapter 3**

may be called “ educated common sense ” to determine whether a link exists  
between two moves. In a perfect study, three judges are employed and the  
decision “ link ” or “ no link ” is determined by the majority: consensus or  
two votes for one of the two options.^4 No encoding of moves is required; we  
want only to establish the existence of links, or the lack thereof.  
How is a parsed protocol analyzed for links among moves? It is done  
systematically, by asking “ Is there a link? ” for every pair of moves in a  
sequence. First we number the moves sequentially. Then, starting with  
move 2, we test whether it has a link to move 1\. Next we go to move 3 and  
test whether it has a link to move 2 and whether it has a link to move 1\. For  
move *n* , we have to ask this question *n* – 1 times for possible links between  
move *n* and all preceding moves, namely 1, 2, 3,... , *n* – 1\. For *n* moves,  
we must perform this test *n* ( *n* – 1)/2 times in order to include every pair of  
moves in the sequence. Figure 3.1 illustrates the process of testing for links  
in a sequence of five moves; the number of tests is 5(5 – 1)/2 \= 10\.  
The tests described above were performed directionally — that is, we  
tested for links between every move and each of the preceding moves. The  
direction is backward in terms of a linear sequence in time. Any links we  
establish this way are therefore called *backlinks*. The symbol \< denotes back-  
linking. However, once we have established a backlink, say between move  
2 and move 1, we may also refer to a forward-bound link, or a *forelink* ,  
between move 1 and move 2\. Forelinking is denoted by the symbol \>. We  
say “ forward ” because this is a link between a move (move 1\) and an ante-  
rior move (move 2). Forelinks are therefore virtual and can be established  
only after the fact. Every link is one move ’ s backlink and the other move ’ s  
forelink. Therefore, the number of backlinks and forelinks is equal, and if

**Figure 3.1**  
Testing for links among five moves. The test is performed ten times.

**Design Synthesis 49**

we add up all backlinks and forelinks we obtain twice the total number of  
actual links. Figure 3.2 shows a link between moves 1 and 2; the same link  
is move 2 ’ s backlink and move 1 ’ s forelink.  
In a sequence that contains more than two moves (as practically all  
design episodes do), we get a network of links that are represented as  
nodes. Most network depictions or graphs of processes represent the enti-  
ties (moves, in this case) as nodes and the links as connecting lines. Here  
we wish to concentrate on links; they are our variable, and therefore they  
have become nodes in a graph that portrays the network of links among  
moves. The representation is therefore called a *linkograph*. Figure 3.3 shows  
a linkograph in which five moves are interconnected through six links. In  
this linkograph, move 1 has one forelink (to move 3). Move 2 has no back-  
link but has two forelinks (to moves 4 and 5). Move 3 has one backlink (to

**50 Chapter 3**

move 1\) and two forelinks (to moves 4 and 5). Move 4 has two backlinks (to  
moves 2 and 3\) and one forelink (to move 5). Move 5 has three backlinks  
(to moves 2, 3, and 4). A move ’ s backlinks are “ strung ” along grid lines  
that originate at the moves and turn diagonally leftward to meet the linked  
move. Respectively, forelinks are lined along grid lines that originate at  
the moves and turn diagonally rightward, again to meet the linked move.  
Obviously, the first move can never have backlinks and the last move can  
never have forelinks.  
Why do we stipulate forelinks, and why is it logical and beneficial to  
distinguish between backlinks and forelinks? Let us remember that design  
synthesis at the micro (cognitive) level is understood as emanating from a  
search that consists of cycles of acts of ideation and evaluation. These acts  
gradually shape an original design proposal, or solution, until it can be  
deemed appropriate. The design acts in question are defined as moves, and  
we posit that links among them enable an integrated end result, or a “ good  
fit ” of the synthesis. Are originality and appropriateness achieved in the  
same way? They cannot possibly be achieved in the same way. To achieve  
originality, the designer must propose something. To ensure appropriate-  
ness, it is necessary to evaluate a proposal by ensuring that it is consis-  
tent with previous steps taken to accommodate requirements; if it is not,  
there may be contradictions (misfits), which are likely to cause difficulties  
or even to lead to the failure of a proposed solution that does not meet the  
requirements. Since moves are very small steps, it is never enough to pro-  
pose something; further steps must build on it (or challenge it) and develop  
it in order to arrive at a complete synthesis. Likewise, when we evaluate,  
we often match a proposal with several previously raised issues. When we  
propose, we look forward, and the move we make will probably link to  
further subsequent moves, which follow immediately thereafter or occur  
later in the process. When we evaluate or assess, we look backward to what  
has already been done to make sure that a good fit exists between the cur-  
rent move and previous work, and that no apparent contradictions, mis-  
matches, or other negative consequences are evident in the design process.  
Looking backward creates backlinks. Looking forward creates forelinks. The  
two types of links have very different meanings, and therefore we distin-  
guish between them. Such a distinction can be expressed in quantitative  
terms, and expressing them quantitatively is significant when we analyze  
and when we compare protocols of design sessions.

**Design Synthesis 51**

To demonstrate this notion, let us return to the brief vignette from Mar-  
tin ’ s process of designing a small library that was presented earlier in this  
chapter. Here is the vignette again, parsed into three moves:

*Move 1* We start creating a hierarchy: the large trees, the parking lots, the  
pedestrians, an entry axis.

*Move 2* I would then look for a direct relationship between entrance and  
exterior, because here, the real edge is not this \[edge of building\], for me it ’ s  
that \[edge of site\].

*Move 3* I would try to have an important element; would therefore make  
the axis I mentioned before, this one \[points to sketch\].

Martin had been given a shape representing a library ’ s “ footprint ” in the  
middle of a rectangular site. In move 1 he referred to the site, in which  
there were large trees and on which he had placed parking lots and deter-  
mined where the entry to the library would be. Martin is an architect who  
often uses axes in his designs (Wrede 1986), an axis being an imaginary  
line that visually connects design elements. In this vignette, as a matter of  
habit or routine, he talked about creating an “ entry axis. ” Move 2 expanded  
on the relationship between the entrance and the exterior, and, since this  
move referred to the entry and its axis mentioned in move 1, a backlink  
is established between move 2 and move 1\. In move 3 Martin returned to  
the entry axis of move 1 and asserted that it was an “ important element. ”  
Move 3 therefore has a backlink to move 1, but it does not relate to the  
relationship to the exterior and therefore it is not linked to move 2\. After  
the fact we see that, whereas move 2 has no forelink to move 3, move 1  
has forelinks to both move 2 and move 3\. Move 2 asserts the position of  
the entry as part of a hierarchical arrangement of elements connected by  
an axis. Move 3 provides an explanation for the axis: it is an important  
element. Move 1 also connects building elements with outdoor elements,  
and move 2 explains that this is done because, for Martin, the extent of  
the design is the building together with its surroundings, ending only at  
the edges of the site. A linkograph depicting the network of moves and  
links in this short vignette is shown in figure 3.4. This example demon-  
strates that a good fit between a proposal and its rationale is not pulled  
out of the designer ’ s sleeve as a “ fait accompli ” but is built up small step  
by small step. Proposals are made and then assessed, or a rationale is put  
forth and a suitable embodiment is then proposed; the order in which

**52 Chapter 3**

these types of moves succeed one another makes no difference (Gold-  
schmidt 2012).  
As was claimed earlier, good design boasts a well-integrated solution that  
takes care of the many issues that must be addressed. Good and creative  
design also manifests a coherent, novel, comprehensive “ leading idea ” that  
elevates the design from a mere solution to a problem to a social, artistic,  
technological, or generally cultural statement that is appreciated by the  
public at large. A leading idea is not a “ thing apart ” ; rather, all design deci-  
sions must be compatible with it. This is precisely what a design synthesis  
denotes. If this is indeed the case, then understanding the properties of the  
network of links among design moves should shed light on the thinking  
that brings into being well-integrated works of design — both good, creative  
ones and lesser ones.  
Linkography thus concerns itself with links among design moves, as it  
is believed that this is the best way to capture the essence of design cogni-  
tion and behavior. Although links are associated with the achievement of  
synthesis, it must be emphasized that linkography does not explain cau-  
sality, as the actual contents of design moves is disregarded after links are  
established (contents may, of course, be visited in complimentary analy-  
ses). Linkography is flexible, since base lines for variables to be measured  
can be calibrated to suit the needs of a study. However, we must insist on  
consistency in handling the data and in performing the analyses.

## 4 The Linkograph: A Network of Links

Chapter 3 introduced the origin of the linkograph as a way to notate  
design moves and the links among them. The first linkographs were  
drawn by hand, usually on grid paper. Figure 4.1 is an example from circa

1993. In the early 1990s the first little piece of software for the production  
      of linkographs was created by Shahar Dumai. Called MacLinkograph, it  
      was meant for Macintosh computers. Unfortunately it was not upgraded  
      when new operating systems replaced the one we had been working  
      with, and eventually MacLinkograph became obsolete. By using a Java  
      platform, Link ographer, developed in 2004 – 05, avoided the fate of its

# predecessor.

A linkograph is basically a modified representation of a matrix; indeed,  
some researchers prefer to stick to a matrix representation (see, e.g., van der  
Lugt 2001). The graphic notation used here for linkographs is a directed  
graph, although no arrows are used. It was chosen because it emphasizes  
the arrangement of the links in a network. The grid lines make the visual-  
ization of the network and its structure particularly compelling, and this  
representation is superior if we wish to emphasize the idea of links as nodes  
rather than connecting lines. Matrix representations are, however, perfectly  
legitimate, and for certain purposes (coding, for example) they may have  
advantages, especially for a long linkograph that contains more than 100  
moves.  
Either way, a linkograph may be seen as an enlarged depiction of a  
very small design space within which the designer is working at a specific  
moment. Links alone do not give a complete description of the design  
space of course, and the depiction is therefore partial. Nonetheless, it allows  
access to the designer ’ s thinking process at that point. If we also encode  
the moves (and we could even encode the links), the picture becomes quite

**54 Chapter 4**

comprehensive. No other representation of the design space yields the kind  
of information that can be inferred from a linkograph. In our studies, a  
complete picture of the design space was not the main concern. Wanting to  
look at the “ how ” of the design process, we left out the “ what. ” The linko-  
graph serves this purpose very well.  
Linkographer displays a network that, in addition to space for nodes that  
are the links, has the following:

* a line for sequential move numbers (the number of moves is flexible)^1  
* background grid lines wherein the portions that are activated when a link  
  is notated are highlighted  
* horizontal lines to indicate the span of links (discussed later in this  
  chapter)  
* a line to identify designers (useful for team design sessions)

In addition, there are three lines for the indication of critical moves, to  
which chapter 5 is devoted. Figure 4.2 shows the Linkographer template

# ready to be used.

The next few sections describe the different types of moves according to  
the links they generate, and the structure of the design session as portrayed  
in a linkograph in terms of link distribution and patterns in the network.  
Also featured is the span of linked moves — that is, how far apart linked

**Figure 4.1**  
Portions of two adjacent linkographs (D22 and D23) drawn by hand on grid paper.

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 55**

moves are. A general measure of the density of links in a linkograph or part  
thereof is also introduced, and a glimpse of one other linkograph represen-  
tation is presented.

**Types of Moves and Their Linking Patterns**

The rate of link generation is not fixed. Some moves generate more links  
than others, and generated links may be mainly backlinks or mainly  
forelinks. We identify three types of moves: orphan moves, unidirectional  
moves, and bidirectional moves. In addition, we distinguish a class of richly  
linked moves called *critical moves*.  
An example will illustrate the different kinds of moves. The protocol in  
question records a team of three undergraduate industrial design students  
(A, B, and C) working on the design of a movable ashtray for use by large  
numbers of smokers in an outdoor location such as a park or a beach. In this  
part of the design process, the designers discuss a proposal that envisages  
an “ ashtray ” (or rather a device that fulfills the same purpose) in the form  
of a big sticky surface onto which smokers can toss their cigarette butts.  
The discussion lasted a few minutes, during which 27 moves were made. At

**Figure 4.2**

**56 Chapter 4**

the 27th move the discussion switched to another alternative solution.^2 A  
linkograph notating the links among the 27 moves in this short vignette is

# shown in figure 4.3.

A few features of the link pattern are immediately apparent. The pro-  
cess can be seen as having two parts: from move 1 to move 14 few links  
are generated, and from move 14 to move 26 many links are generated. I  
shall comment on this difference a little later; here, the difference between  
moves in terms of links they generate, or do not generate, is discussed.

**Orphan moves**  
There is one move in the ashtray linkograph above that has no links at all:  
move 11, which reads “ What happens if it starts raining? ” In evaluating the  
emerging design, it occurred to designer C, who made this move, that the  
solution would have to be effective in all kinds of weather. She asked how  
rain might affect the ashtray. The question of dry or wet conditions had  
not come up earlier in the discussion, and the teammates paid no atten-  
tion to it, perhaps because they did not consider it relevant and perhaps  
because they thought it should be addressed later. Therefore, this move has  
no link to any previous move, nor does any subsequent move in the present

**Figure 4.3**  
Linkograph of ashtray design vignette.

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 57**

sequence link to it. Hence, move 11 has no links. Such a move is referred  
to as an *orphan move*. Small numbers of orphan moves can be found in  
many linkographs, but we observe more of them when the designers are  
novices than when they are experienced and expert. A possible reason for  
this is that experts are able to anticipate the implications of their moves for  
longer stretches of future probable moves. In chess, for example, masters  
spin longer chains of planned future moves than novices (Chase and Simon  
1973). In chess as in design, this makes it easier for experts to avoid orphan  
moves.

**Unidirectional and bidirectional moves**  
The following moves have only backlinks: move 4, move 7, move 8, move  
9, move 12, move 13, move 26, and, of course, the last move, 27, which  
by definition can have no forelinks. In contrast, other moves have only  
forelinks — in this case, the first move 1 (by definition) and moves 2 and

5. Moves that link only backward or only forward are called *unidirectional* ,  
   whereas the others are bidirectional, as they have links both backward and  
   forward. Unidirectionality is, of course, the only possibility for the first and  
   the last move. Other unidirectional moves suggest that at the instant of  
   their generation the designer was concentrating either on what had trans-  
   pired up to that point (in the case of backlinks only), or on new thoughts  
   that left behind what had been done thus far, but to which later moves  
   form links.  
   All other moves in this sequence, with the exception of the orphan move  
   11, are bidirectional. If we count out the two extreme moves, we have seven  
   unidirectional moves with backlinks only ( \< Udir), or 28 percent; two unidi-  
   rectional moves with forelinks only (Udir \> ), or 8 percent; and a majority of  
   fifteen bidirectional moves, or 60 percent. The proportion of bidirectional  
   moves, close to two-thirds, is typical, although on average the proportion  
   tends to be a little higher for experienced designers. The ratio of \< Udir to  
   Udir \> moves is 3.5:1, which is on the high side; the average in some other  
   cases is around 2:1. In our sample, nearly all of the unidirectional moves are  
   concentrated in the first half of the sequence we are looking at, whereas the  
   second half, from move 14 onward, is characterized by an overwhelming  
   dominance of bidirectional moves. This may suggest a sequence that is not  
   very well integrated. The balance between bidirectional and unidirectional  
   moves, and the proportion of both in the overall number of moves, may

**58 Chapter 4**

teach us something about the nature of the work done in this particular  
sequence of moves. More important, bidirectional moves suggest a rapid  
shift between the two modes of reasoning that are associated with diver-  
gent and convergent thinking. As was mentioned in chapter 3, the flexibil-  
ity to shift between divergent and convergent thinking is typical of creative  
thinking. In this vignette, the first part is “ weak ” in that little progress was  
made, whereas in the “ strong ” second half more creativity was evident  
(this topic is elaborated further in chapter 6).

**Critical moves**  
We have distinguished between moves with and without links and between  
moves that form links solely forward or backward and those with links in  
both directions. We now want to concern ourselves with special, and argu-  
ably the most important moves, those forming a particularly large number  
of links. They are called *critical moves* (CMs). Moves vary in the number of  
links they generate. If our basic premise that links are a primary indicator  
of the quality of the process is correct, it follows that critical moves are of  
special significance.  
How many links must a move have in order to qualify as critical? The  
answer is that the number depends on the “ grain ” of the analysis, or the  
overall number of links. “ Grain ” pertains to the propensity of the researcher  
to establish links when analyzing a design episode. If the inclination is  
toward stringency in judging whether links exist, the overall number of  
links will not be very high and therefore a relatively low number of links  
will suffice in order for a move to be considered critical. If more leeway is  
allowed in establishing links, the number of links will be high and more  
links will be necessary in order for a move to be seen as critical. The thresh-  
old number for qualifying links as critical is therefore flexible, and it is  
established in each study in accordance with the analysis granularity and  
the goals of the study. Sometimes more than one threshold is used in the  
same study, for the purpose of comparison between parameters under the  
different thresholds. We therefore have to indicate the threshold when we  
talk of critical moves. We do so by adding it in superscript: CM t , where t  
is the chosen threshold. Linkographer can indicate critical moves at three  
different thresholds, as shown in figure 4.2. It is good practice to choose  
a threshold that yields about 10 – 12 percent CMs of the total number of  
moves in a sequence.^3

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 59**

It is important to clarify how the designated number of links is counted.  
We could look at the overall number of links a move generates, or at the  
number of links in one of the two directions (backward or forward). Because  
it allows richer insights into the process, the second option was chosen so  
that criticality indicates links in one direction, either backward or forward.  
In other words, it is sufficient that a move generate a designated number of  
links in one direction to be labeled critical, regardless of the number of links  
it generates in the opposite direction. This is also indicated in the notation:  
\< CM t designates a critical move due to t or more links backward, whereas  
CM t \> notates a critical move due to t or more links forward. Only in rare  
cases does a move have as many as the threshold number of links (or more),  
both backward and forward — that is, at least 2t links in all. For a threshold  
t, the notation in this case is \< CM t \>. The notation of CMs in Linkographer  
distinguishes between \< CMs and CMs \> at each threshold level.  
In the ashtray linkograph shown in figure 4.3, critical moves are speci-  
fied at three thresholds: 5, 6, and 7\. At the highest threshold we have three  
CMs as follows: moves 24 and 26 are \< CM^7 s; move 14 is a CM^7 \>. As we  
lower the threshold, more moves “ pass ” the criticality test; in this case,  
only CMs \> are added to the count of critical moves: moves 14, 17 and 20  
qualify as CM^6 s \> ; at the level of CM^5 \> we find moves 3, 14, 16, 17, and 20\.  
There are no \< CMs \> in this sequence at any of the designated thresholds.  
Of all moves, 11 percent are CM^7 s, 19 percent are CM^6 s, and 26 percent  
are CM^5 s. For most purposes we would choose a threshold of seven links  
for this sequence in the various calculations concerning critical moves.  
Critical moves are of great importance in linkography; their significance  
is explained and demonstrated in the next chapter. Here, however, let us  
look at the linkograph ’ s structure, which is determined by patterns of link  
distribution in the network.

**Distribution of Links**

Figure 4.3 shows clearly that moves vary in the numbers of links they gener-  
ate. This is not surprising in a spontaneous exploratory process of thinking  
wherein a large number of issues are examined. How are links distributed in  
relation to the moves that generate them?  
Whereas orphan moves have no links at all, critical moves generate, by  
definition, a large number of links. As we have seen, the criticality threshold

is adjustable and is optimally set for the proportion of CMs to be around  
10 – 12 percent. Because the links form a network, it would be interesting  
to find out whether the percentage of links generated by critical moves  
is constant, and if so what this percentage is. We set out to find how the  
networks behave in this respect. Because of a possible incompatibility due  
to different thresholds for criticality, we did not calculate the percentage of  
links associated with critical moves in various studies. Instead, the contri-  
bution of links by the top 10 percent of moves was recorded — that is, the  
10 percent that had the largest number of links. This was done for several  
studies of experienced and student designers (see appendix). The results are

# reported in table 4.1.

The results confirm that critical moves contribute more than their share  
in the move “ population. ” Their contribution appears to be quite constant  
across sequences of varying lengths (numbers of moves), ranging from twice  
the average contribution of all moves in the case of experienced designers

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 61**

to a factor of two and a half in the case of novices (design students).^4 These  
ratios are not very high, but they are still significant. If we remember that the  
percentage of critical moves is sometimes 12 or even higher, we may expect  
an even larger contribution of critical moves to the general network of links.  
In sequences of up to 100 moves we find that moves can have any  
number of links between zero and more than a dozen. Interestingly, for  
sequences no shorter than about 20 moves, the average number of links per  
move (the link index; see later in this chapter) is fairly stable. Regardless of  
sequence length and experience of the participants, it is around 2.0. This  
means two backlinks and two forelinks per move, because each link is one  
move ’ s backlink and another move ’ s forelink. Therefore, if links are not to  
be counted twice, the number of links in a sequence refers to the total num-  
ber of backlinks only, or forelinks only, or the sum of half of each.  
The frequency of link generation — that is, how many moves generate a  
certain number of links (backward \+ forward) — tends to be a normal distri-  
bution, as figure 4.4 shows. Orphan moves on one end and critical moves on  
the other end cause the frequency graph to be asymmetrical, as all orphan  
moves generate 0 links but critical moves vary in the number of links they  
generate, thus we get a tail that represents a small number of moves that  
generate a large number of links. If we disregard the right-hand tail of the  
graph (that is, a small number of extreme critical moves, in this case those  
with more than eleven links), we get a normal distribution. The peak of the  
distribution, at four links per move, is created by 15.4 percent of all moves.  
Each of these moves generates four links (in both directions), and together  
they contribute 12.3 percent of all links. This is the largest group of moves  
with the same number of links. Moves that generate up to three links, and  
moves that generate five or more links, form smaller groups. Obviously, as  
can also be concluded from table 4.1, the higher the number of links per  
move, the higher is the proportional contribution of a certain group to all  
links. In this study, 29 moves (only 4.6 percent of all moves) have eleven  
or more links each, and contribute 12.5 percent of all links. We see that the  
contribution of a small group of link-intensive moves is roughly equal to  
that of the much larger group of moves having an average number of links.  
Figure 4.4 represents a single study, but it is based on a fairly large sam-  
ple: 624 moves. We cannot expect a similarly normal distribution in small  
samples, or single linkographs, especially short ones. However, the domi-  
nance of a relatively small number of moves that generate a large number

**62 Chapter 4**

of links is clear in all cases, and we should therefore pay special attention to  
these moves and their role in the process of designing.

figure 4.5 , presents three different linking patterns that are visibly discern-  
ible in linkographs: chunk, web, and sawtooth track.

**Chunk**  
As has already been pointed out, this linkograph is visibly divided into  
two halves, the first half comprising moves 1 – 14 and the second moves  
14 – 26\. Move 27 links back to the first move, but at the same time it breaks  
away and turns to a different potential solution. Move 14 is a pivot move  
that connects the two halves. Each of the halves is graphically distinct as  
a discernible triangle called a *chunk*. This case is extreme in that the two  
chunks of the linkograph are connected by a single move. Sometimes there

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 63**

is no pivot move, but in most cases we find a few links between adjacent  
chunks, through moves that are not necessarily pivots but create an overlap  
between chunks. Chunks may also be entirely separate, with no links at all  
to connect them. A chunk is a block of links among successive moves that  
form links almost exclusively among themselves and are loosely or not at  
all interconnected with other moves. Typically, chunks are created by a  
sequence of between a dozen and two dozen moves, but sometimes they  
are longer and reach three dozen moves. More substantial chunks were not  
found, even in long linkographs. This may be related to the finding that  
the maximum number of symbols retrievable from short-term memory is  
constant (Ericsson and Simon 1984/1993).  
What is the significance of chunks in the design process? The interlinked  
moves within a chunk stand for a cross-examination of relevant proper-  
ties, related questions, and possible implications of a design issue. When  
this examination is exhausted, at least for the time being, or when it is  
interrupted, a new cycle of thought begins in which another issue comes  
under scrutiny. While inspecting one issue, a designer (or a team) focuses  
on that issue and directs almost all of his or her (or its) attention to it;  
only occasionally is the issue related to a previous topic, and this is where  
we find links to previous chunks. This mode of thinking reinforces our

**Figure 4.5**  
Link patterns in ashtray linkograph.

**64 Chapter 4**

understanding of design problem solving as a sequence of examinations  
of subproblems that are limited in scope. There comes a point of course in  
which subproblems are consolidated and solutions are integrated, or syn-  
thesized, into a single design proposal. Chunks reflect the structure of the  
thinking process, which is easily captured in a linkograph thanks to its  
graphic properties.  
In some linkographs it is difficult to define chunks. We can assume that  
the processes they represent are less structured than processes with clear  
chunking, as there is no sequential treatment of clearly outlined issues.  
Figure 4.6 is an example of such a linkograph. Linkographs with no chunks  
represent poorly structured processes and are an indication of inefficient  
design thinking and reasoning.

**Web**  
A *web* is formed when a large number of links are generated among a rela-  
tively small number of moves. As in the case of a chunk, the geometry of  
the linkograph dictates a triangular enclosure of the web. In the ashtray  
linkograph we see a clear web of links between moves 14 and 19 (see figure  
4.5). The links that interconnect moves 20 – 26 may also be considered as

**Figure 4.6**  
A poorly structured design process: a linkograph with no chunks (MIT library study,  
Gideon).

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 65**

a web. The web is a portion of the network in which the density of links  
is especially high. Webs are smaller than chunks and are not found in all  
linkographs.  
What does a web signify? It records a brief and intensive passage of a few  
moves in which a certain issue is very thoroughly inspected and its aspects  
are woven together to make sure they are in agreement with one another.  
For example, in moves 14 – 19 in the ashtray vignette the team discussed  
the prospect of having to deal with heavy smokers who smoke 40 cigarettes  
a day. In move 20 they went on to talk about average smokers and their  
habits. Webs are found when something needs particular clarification or  
when an idea is being built up by bringing up several of its aspects almost  
concurrently. Miller ’ s (1956) finding that we can entertain 7 ± 2 items in  
short-term memory when processing information explains the fact that  
most webs pertain to a sequence of no more than seven densely interlinked  
moves. The web in figure 4.5, for example, comprises six moves (moves  
14 – 19), and the sequence 20 – 26 is seven moves long.

**Sawtooth track**  
In some instances a sequence of moves link each to the preceding move.  
The link lines in such a case describe a zigzag pattern reminiscent of a saw-  
tooth. When this occurs, we conclude that the thinking at that point is very  
linear — one thing leads to the next, and each move reacts to what was just  
said or done, without a more holistic view. In the ashtray vignette we have  
an example of a very short sawtooth track between moves 22 and 26\. To  
qualify as a sawtooth track, at least four moves must be involved; however,  
most sawtooth tracks are much longer. Sawtooth tracks are found especially  
in vignettes wherein the number of issues discussed is very small and in sit-  
uations such as question-and-answer sequences in teams or teacher-student  
interactions in the studio during a “ desk crit. ” When sawtooth tracks are  
not integral parts of a larger network but rather stand alone, we may con-  
clude that at that point the designer is not engaged in a synthesis process  
but rather builds one observation or proposition upon another in a linear  
string, with no attempt to widen or deepen the investigation.

**Link Span**

The distance between two linked moves is called a *link span* (L.S.).^5 In the  
case of sawtooth tracks, moves link to immediately adjacent moves, and

**66 Chapter 4**

the link span is therefore L.S. \= 1\. Move 6 in the ashtray linkograph has  
backlinks to moves 3 and 5 and a forelink to move 7\. For the links of move  
6 to moves 5 and 7, L.S. \= 1\. For the link to move 3, however, L.S. \= 3\. In  
the same linkograph, the farthest-apart linked moves are moves 1 and 27;  
in this case, L.S. \= 26 (see figure 4.7 ).  
Because of the geometry of the linkograph, all links with the same L.S.  
are horizontally aligned, and the horizontal grid lines on which they are  
strung are visible. Linkographer can count the number of links on each of  
these lines (that is, for each L.S. value). This count is (optionally) displayed  
to the right of the linkograph. Figure 4.7 shows the L.S. count for the ash-  
tray linkograph.  
Link span values are worthy of a more detailed study; they are correlated  
here with what we know about cognition in general and design cognition in  
particular. Because of memory limitations, it is not easy to refer to a thought  
one had a long time ago, unless the earlier thought was particularly impor-  
tant and meaningful. At the micro-scale we are talking about, “ a long time ”  
means minutes, or hours in extreme cases. Since moves represent brief  
instances of thought, we do not expect them to generate many backlinks to  
moves that were made much earlier, because such moves may have already

**Figure 4.7**  
Ashtray linkograph with counts of link spans.

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 67**

faded away from working memory (with the exception of very significant  
moves, which are also likely to have been reinforced by repetition). Rather,  
we would expect most links to connect moves with relatively recently gen-  
erated moves that are still fresh in working memory. George Miller ’ s 7 ± 2  
dictum is remembered here, which specifies that the processing of informa-  
tion in short-term memory is limited to about seven items. Accordingly,  
we would expect most links to be formed between moves up to L.S. \= 7\.  
Of course, what “ most ” means here has not been specified. Does it mean  
any percentage over 50, or a very elevated percentage (say, 90 or higher)?  
To find out, we plotted the link percentage at L.S. values up to 7 for several  
sample design vignettes. This also allows us to see the buildup to that point.  
The results are shown in figure 4.8. At L.S. \= 7, the designers whose processes  
were linkographed achieved, on average, 78.2 percent of the total number  
of links in the given sequence.^6 At L.S. \= 3, the percentage was 56.6.  
Some qualifications to these findings must be offered immediately.  
First, a distinction should be drawn between short and long sequences. We  
cannot expect similar results for sequences of fewer than 30 moves and

**Figure 4.8**  
Percentage of links per L.S. value.

**68 Chapter 4**

sequences of more than 70 moves. Indeed, we find considerable differences  
between short and long sequences. For example, the level at which 75 per-  
cent of the links are achieved in the Delft linkographs varies between L.S.  
\= 4.7 for short vignettes and L.S. \= 7.1 for long ones. Likewise, for the MIT  
vignettes the values are L.S. \= 6.0 for short and L.S. \= 8.6 for long linko-  
graphs. Short vignettes comprise about two dozen moves, generated in a  
little under three minutes. Long vignettes comprise about 60 moves, pro-  
duced in about seven minutes. Obviously, the chances of linking back to  
previous moves over a long span may be greater in a seven-minute process  
than in a three-minute process. However, we can clearly see that, for the  
most part, across shorter and longer sequences, the achievement of links  
is within the bounds of Miller ’ s dictum^7 : nearly all designers and design  
teams achieved 75 – 80 percent of links among moves at L.S. \= 6 or 7 (see  
figure 4.8 ).  
We must bear in mind, though, that we have found the link spans at  
which 75 – 80 percent of links are achieved to be up to six or seven moves  
apart. But the remaining 20 – 25 percent of links occur at longer spans,  
beyond Miller ’ s dictum. How do we explain such linking? For example, in  
the ashtray linkograph (figures 4.5 and 4.7), Move 14 links back to move 1  
and forward to move 26, and the respective link spans are L.S. \= 13 and L.S.  
\= 12\. Let us look at the three moves in question:

*Move 1* So there we have to make some choice

*Move 14* Maybe we should write down some criteria because I think that  
this \[points\] maybe... but if people have 40 cigarettes a night

*Move 26* Yeah, but if you go two or three times and you smoke 15 then this  
thing is not useful. Because you will not proceed....

The first half of move 14 “ closed ” a cycle dedicated to the clarification of  
the problem and a short, brainstorming-like session in which some pre-  
liminary solution concepts were suggested. By the time move 14 was made,  
the designer who made the move felt that, in order to continue the work,  
evaluation criteria would have to be established, and this marked the end  
of the cycle (chunk) that started with move 1, to which move 14 linked.  
The second half of move 14 raised a new issue — that of heavy smokers.  
This started an intensive discussion on the implications of heavy smok-  
ing behavior that ended in move 26, which linked back to each and every  
move in this cycle, or chunk. In both cases the link spans are quite long

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 69**

(although occasionally we encounter linkographs with longer spans). Two  
hypothetical explanations come to mind. First, in teamwork longer link  
spans are more frequent because each team member may relate to his or  
her previous moves, regardless of moves by other team members that were  
made in between this designer ’ s moves. Second, if sketching takes place  
by an individual or by team members, the sketches serve as an external  
memory extension that is available to the designer(s) during the session,  
thus circumventing memory limitations such as those expressed in Miller ’ s  
dictum. Since sketching is very common in design sessions, it comes as no  
surprise that in 20 – 25 percent of cases link spans are longer than L.S. \= 7\.

**Link Index**

The number of links in linkographs varies greatly among cases. There are  
individual differences of course, but the most influential factor is the length  
of the linkograph. In a network comprising a large number of moves, there  
is a larger potential for links. Let us remember that in a saturated network  
the number of potential links is *n* ( *n* – 1)/2, where *n* is the number of moves  
(a saturated network is entirely hypothetical; no such networks occur in  
reality). Let us calculate this number for a network with 50 moves. The  
number of potential links is 50(50 – 1)/2 \= 1,225. If we add just one move,  
the number of potential links becomes 51(51 – 1)/2 \= 1,275. In other words,  
the addition of one move adds 50 new potential opportunities for links  
(links of the 51st move to all previous 50 moves). Therefore, it is not pos-  
sible to compare processes and their linkographs on the basis of the nomi-  
nal number of links. Consequently, we talk about the proportion of links in  
a network, and the term we use is *link index* (L.I.). A link index is the ratio  
between the number of links and the number of moves that generate them  
in a linkograph or part thereof, expressed as a proportion. The highest L.I.s  
are found in webs, which are defined *a priori* as high-link-density groups  
of moves. The same session may display different L.I. values for different  
phases. For example, in the ashtray linkograph the number of moves is  
27 and the number of links is 60\. Therefore, L.I. 1 – 27 \= 2.2. If we calculate  
L.I.s for the two halves of the linkograph separately (in which case the link  
between move 27 and move 1 is not included), we get L.I. 1 – 14 \= 1.1 and  
L.I. 14 – 27 \= 3.1. This is in line with the visible difference in linking activity  
between the two halves of the process, as captured in the linkograph.

**70 Chapter 4**

A link index is a fast indication of the amount of linking activity in a  
design episode, which in turn hints at the designer ’ s effort to achieve a syn-  
thesis. However, we must be careful not to conclude that a high L.I is neces-  
sarily a hallmark of good or creative design. A high L.I. may be the result of  
many repetitions or many attempts to explore alternative ideas with little  
continuity among them. Indeed, we found no correlation between L.I. val-  
ues and design quality (Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005). The link index is  
thus a value that must be used cautiously and only where appropriate.

**Matrix Linkographs**

As was noted at the outset of this chapter, a linkograph is based on a simple  
matrix, and the notation used here is preferred because of its visualization  
power. However, a matrix is also a possible choice. For an example, see fig-  
ure 4.9 , in which the units of analysis are ideas generated by a team of four  
designers in an idea-generating session. Among the criteria Remko van der  
Lugt (2001; also see appendix) used to determine the session ’ s success was  
the building of ideas on ideas previously expressed by teammates. To that

**Figure 4.9**  
Matrix linkograph (van der Lugt 2001). Ideas generated by team members are listed  
chronologically. Reprinted with permission.

**The Linkograph: A Network of Links 71**

end, van der Lugt inferred ideas that were raised in the session and listed  
them in a matrix-type linkograph. Next he marked links among them as  
black squares in the matrix. For each link, the initials of the participants  
whose ideas were linked were marked in the appropriate black link square:  
first the originator of an idea, then the participant whose idea built on it.  
This facilitated identifying the links between members of the team and,  
conversely, the links wherein a participant built on his or her own earlier  
idea. The results were compared across teams and across methods of idea  
generation.  
Another feature of van der Lugt ’ s work that is worth noting, irrespective  
of the chosen modality of representation, is his distinction among different  
types of links. Since in his study links are transformations of ideas, van der  
Lugt, building on work done by Stanley Gryskiewicz (1980), proposed three  
types of transformations:

*Supplementary* Small change results in minor improvements.

*Modification* Structural changes in an idea result in a major change while  
preserving core aspects of the original idea.

*Tangential* There is a major “ leap ” to a new concept, based on a remote  
association with the original idea.

Coding the links can be useful, and one should keep in mind the possi-  
bility of executing such coding, along with the possibility of coding moves,  
as in conventional protocol analysis. Such coding does not contradict link-  
ography, but rather is capable of augmenting it.

## 5 Critical Moves

Let us reiterate the fundamental premise underlying the linkography the-  
ory, which is that the quality and the creativity of a design process depend  
on the designer ’ s ability to synthesize a solution that exhibits a good fit  
among all its components. The solution must respond to a large number  
of requirements and desires; beyond that, a creative solution is expected to  
be novel and exciting. The claim is that at the micro scale such synthesis is  
achieved by interlinking the very small design steps called *moves* that are  
made in the process of designing. A logical consequence of this assertion  
is the hypothesis that critical moves (moves with a particularly high num-  
ber of links) are especially significant in the design process. A distinction  
is made between critical moves due to backlinks ( \< CMs) and those due to  
forelinks (CMs \> ); on rare occasions moves have a large number of links in  
both directions ( \< CMs \> ). It was also stipulated that “ criticality ” is estab-  
lished on the basis of a threshold number of links (in either direction), and  
that this threshold is determined case by case according to the granularity  
of the study. It is also possible to set more than one threshold in the same  
study for the purpose of examining a process at multiple levels. To check  
the hypothesis that critical moves are indeed the most significant moves  
in a sequence, the next sections look at several studies that establish the  
relevance of critical moves as indicators of important properties of thinking  
in the design process.

**The Critical-Path Test**

Ming-Hung Wang and John Habraken (1982) studied the design pro-  
cess from the point of view of the necessary and sufficient constituent  
operations involved, and their sequence. In their view, there are six such

**74 Chapter 5**

operations (see appendix).^1 They used a think-aloud protocol of a design  
session to demonstrate that. A designer was asked to arrange furniture and  
other items (referred to as *variants* ) in an apartment, the plan of which was  
provided. The task was deliberately made very simple so that the study  
could focus on essentials. The protocol was broken into design steps in  
which decisions were made. Next the operations that were carried out at  
about the same time were consolidated into one step. In a total of 12 steps,  
35 decisions were made. Wang and Habraken then drew a network graph  
that represented the process according to their analysis, wherein nodes  
stand for decisions and connecting arrows stand for operations. Figure 5.1  
shows the final network graph.  
Wang and Habraken proceeded to determine a critical path that included  
eight major decisions made in the course of the process, identified by their

**Figure 5.1**  
Network graph, adapted from Wang and Habraken 1982\. At each step, the designer  
made decisions (represented by nodes) concerning one or more variants. To reach  
decisions, the designer carried out operations (represented by arrows). Dotted arrows  
represent “ dummies ” that refer to “ information flow between nodes, without time  
and labor costs. ” Because Wang and Habraken emphasized the importance of these  
dummies, they are treated here as full-fledged equivalents of operations.

**Critical Moves 75**

sequential numbers: 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 14, 19, 20\. This critical path was based  
on their expert assessment of the evidence in the protocol (the contents of  
the decisions are not relevant to the present discussion).  
The linkograph shown in figure 5.2 is based on information in figure  
5.1. However, in this linkograph nodes are links, and Wang and Habraken ’ s  
nodes — design decisions — are constants. Decisions are equated with moves,  
and links are Wang and Habraken ’ s operations.  
Using the linkograph, we can single out the decisions that have the high-  
est number of links. Here we borrow Wang and Habraken ’ s use of the term  
“ critical path, ” but we establish an independent critical path. This critical  
path is not based on an educated assessment of the process as in Wang and  
Habraken; it is based on a count of decisions with at least three backlinks or  
forelinks (a threshold that was established for this case^2 ).  
We obtain the following critical path at the level of CM^3 : 1, 5, 10, 14, 19,  
20, 33\. Although this critical path and Wang and Habraken ’ s critical path

**Figure 5.2**  
Linkograph based on Wang and Habraken ’ s network graph (figure 5.1). In this graph  
the nodes represent links among design decisions, here shown as moves. Diagonal  
lines connecting decisions with links are grid lines that have no operational signifi-  
cance, as opposed to Wang and Habraken ’ s network graph. Here they facilitate the  
count of links associated with each decision, and they help perceive the structure of  
the process.

**76 Chapter 5**

are not identical, they are reasonably similar (five identical decisions out of  
eight and seven in the two critical paths, respectively) — see table 5.1. Deci-  
sion 5 is the implementation of decisions 2 and 3, which brings the two  
critical paths even closer.  
We were able to verify a positive relationship between criticality of  
decisions, as determined by the intensity of interlinking, and criticality as  
determined independently by other, unrelated criteria, in this case expert  
assessment. This result supports the notion that important instances of  
designing and design reasoning are indeed detectable by the high num-  
ber of links they form, backward or forward, relative to other moves in  
the same sequence. To further fortify this conclusion, let us now look at  
another study that inspects the change in the number of links with the self-  
assessment of the importance of ideas in students ’ projects.

**Self-Assessment of Ideas**

Dan Tatsa, who was interested in what transpires in the design studio, con-  
ducted a study that involved close scrutiny of students ’ development of  
their semester-long projects (Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005; see appendix).  
He made lists of all design ideas that were raised in each of the projects  
of the eight students who participated in the study. The number of ideas  
was in the hundreds in every case. After the end of the semester, each stu-  
dent was presented with the list corresponding to his or her project and

was asked to mark which of the ideas made a positive contribution or a  
*major* positive contribution to the project. Later, Tatsa called the contribu-  
tions the students had rated major “ very critical ” and the other positive  
contributions simply “ critical ” (other ideas were not marked as positive  
contributions).  
Next, Tatsa set out to generate linkographs with ideas as the unit of  
analysis, a procedure that was repeated three times. First, a linkograph was  
plotted for each student ’ s project in order to get an overview of the pattern  
of links among all ideas. (This was extremely labor intensive — for the proj-  
ect with the highest count of ideas, 275, it was necessary to consider 37,812  
links. Tatsa did all the work.) Second, linkographs were generated that  
looked only at links among the ideas the students had rated as critical. This  
was done for four projects. Further linkographs were drawn for a smaller  
number of ideas — those the students rated as having made a major (very  
critical) contribution to the project. Links for the latter two sets of linko-  
graphs were produced by three judges (the experimenter and two naive  
judges, both expert designers), and were arbitrated by agreement between  
at least two judges. Table 5.2 shows the number of links in all three sets of  
linkographs for the projects by the students Meirav and Ronen. We should  
look at proportions, of course, and therefore the values we are interested in  
are expressed as the link index in each case.  
The results are impressive. We see an incremental increase in the num-  
ber of links generated by an idea with a rise in its self-assessed criticality.^3 In

**Table 5.2**

Meirav ’ s case the link index grew from 0.99 to 1.35 to 2.46 in the shift from  
all ideas to critical ideas to very critical ideas (experimenter ’ s judgment).  
Ronen achieved overall lower L.I. values, but they too grew with critical-  
ity: from 0.67 for all ideas to 0.90 for critical ideas to 1.3 for the ideas he  
deemed very critical (note that the percentage of critical and very critical  
ideas is considerably lower in Ronen ’ s case than in Meirav ’ s). Since these  
are self-assessments it is difficult to calibrate valuations across participating  
students. All the same, the unequivocal conclusion is that the more mean-  
ingful and helpful the idea is according to the student-designer, the denser  
the network of links it is involved in according to the external judges. This  
tendency is noticeable both in the analysis performed by the three judges  
and in the analysis undertaken by the experimenter alone, and it holds  
despite some differences between the experimenter and the three judges  
(which is more pronounced in the case of Meirav).  
As in the study by Wang and Habraken, the value of this investigation  
resides in the fact that the determination of criticality is entirely indepen-  
dent of, and therefore orthogonal to, the link analysis. Our results also cor-  
roborate Remko van der Lugt ’ s (2003) findings that the ideas considered  
most meaningful by the designers themselves in his experiments had a sig-  
nificantly higher number of links than other ideas.  
It is therefore encouraging to reiterate the claim that links among ideas  
(decisions, moves) are of great importance in the cognitive processes  
involved in searching for successful solutions to design problems. This is by  
no means obvious or trivial. Whereas designers are said to be synthesizers of  
ideas almost by definition, we have hitherto had little evidence that this is  
true at the cognitive scale of very small steps (we should remember that the  
duration of design moves is no longer than a few seconds). In particular,  
critical ideas, defined merely by a high number of links they generate to  
other ideas, are also the most important concepts in the eyes of the design-  
ers themselves, although they are not involved in determining links.  
Armed with this affirmation, let us proceed to explore critical moves and  
what they tell us about reasoning in designing.

**Critical Moves as Structure Anchors**

In chapter 4 we saw that linkographs reflect the structure of design thinking  
and reasoning in a sequence under scrutiny. In particular, the presence of

**Critical Moves 79**

chunks tells us that the designer thinks systematically about successions of  
subproblems or issues (see figure 4.5). The lack of chunks is evidence of the  
opposite: that the designer is engaged in thinking about a single issue, or  
is “ jumping ” back and forth among several issues (see figure 4.6). Now we  
want to find out whether the position of critical moves adds to our under-  
standing of the structure of the thinking process. To do so, let us examine  
several design episodes from various studies.

**The Wang-Habraken linkograph revisited**  
Let us take another look at the linkograph of Wang and Habraken ’ s 1982  
study (figure 5.2). It contains two clear and slightly overlapping chunks, the  
first stretching from decision 1 to decision 21 and the second from decision  
19 to decision 33\. Decisions 19, 20, and 21 connect the two chunks; deci-  
sions 34 and 35 can be seen as “ add-ons ” to the second chunk. Here the  
terms “ move ” and “ critical move ” (abbreviated CM) will be used to refer to  
decisions.  
There are seven CM^3 s, most of them in the first chunk. The critical  
moves, by sequential number and dominant direction, are as follows: in  
the first chunk, 1 \> , 5 \> , \< 10, \< 14, and \< 19 \> , and in the second chunk \< 19 \>  
(overlap with the first chunk), 20 \> , and \< 33\. Here and in many other linko-  
graphs, the positioning of the critical moves is not random.  
The first thing we observe regarding the critical moves is that the  
sequence begins with a CM \> (here it is the first move; elsewhere it could  
be a somewhat later move). In a symmetrical manner, it ends with a \< CM  
(here not the last move, but nearly the last). What does that signify? The  
designer started by making a proposition, to be explored in subsequent  
moves. When the sequence achieved a clear ending, there was a conclusive  
move — not necessarily one that pertains to the entire process, but possibly  
one that pertains to the last issue inspected. Indeed, in this linkograph the  
CM \> at the beginning and the \< CM at the end are not linked to each other  
but are linked to other moves in between. They can be seen as initial and  
final moves of chunks rather than as critical moves that begin and end the  
sequence. The first chunk of our linkograph does not have a final \< CM;  
move 1 links to move 21, which is not a CM. In the second chunk, however,  
the first move, 19, is a CM \> (as well as a \< CM). Therefore the second chunk  
begins with a CM \> and ends with a \< CM that is linked to it. This makes a  
lot of sense: if a chunk is a block of moves that treat defined issues, often

**80 Chapter 5**

in order to ascertain that a proposition is viable, then the chunk begins  
with the proposition and ends with a conclusion of some sort. Of course,  
an issue may be left unresolved, or the exploration is short and limited and  
within the same chunk related issues come up, in which case there might  
not be a final \< CM, as in the case of the first chunk in this linkograph. In  
some cases the opposite is also true — that is, a chunk may not have an ini-  
tial CM \> but may have a final \< CM.  
Chunks are relatively large structures. Within them we may find smaller  
structures, such as webs (in the Wang-Habraken linkograph there are no  
webs), or less clear-cut clusters that are visually discernible by the trian-  
gles that outline them. For example, a loosely defined structure can be dis-  
cerned between move 3 and move 10\. Such structures have no name, since  
they are not sufficiently defined, but they may be noticeable. In the small  
structure, the final move, 10, is a \< CM, and it also includes a CM \> , move  
5, that seems to move the process forward with a number of subsequent  
moves that respond to it with backlinks, up to move 10\. Another \< CM  
is found in move 14, but its links are “ local ” — that is, its backlinks have  
short spans (it backlinks to moves 10, 12, and 13\) and it probably has no  
structural significance in the sequence. Likewise, the backlinks of move 19  
are “ local ” (it backlinks to moves 14, 16, and 18), and it is not the closure  
of a longer exploration at the magnitude of a chunk, or even an otherwise  
loosely defined structure.  
On the other hand, the forelinks of move 19 embrace the entire second  
chunk. Together with the next move, 20, which is also a CM \> , they set the  
scene for the design activity in this chunk that ends with the final \< CM.  
Technically move 20 is also part of the first chunk, but its significant links,  
which make it a critical move, pertain to the activity of the second chunk.  
There are no smaller cycles in this chunk; in this it differs from the first  
chunk. \< CMs \> are quite rare, and when they occur they are usually pivot  
moves, as in this case. In the two-way critical move in this vignette, the  
designer summed up what he had done thus far (which concerned the lin-  
ing up of several “ place variants ” ) and got ready to deal with “ unoccupied ”  
space, which he assigned to plants.  
The positions of CMs (most of them, at least) help us to understand the  
structure of the thinking process of the designer. Another detailed exam-  
ple will help to further instantiate the role of critical moves as “ structure  
anchors. ”

**Critical Moves 81**

**The Delft team protocol**  
The Wang-Habraken study draws attention to structural properties of the  
process of design reasoning, which are discernible in both graphic represen-  
tations of the process (figures 5.1 and 5.2). The linkograph is particularly  
revealing in this respect. Despite the simplicity of this case and the lack of  
breakthroughs (for which there was no need in this episode), the analysis  
establishes a hierarchy of more important and less important decisions.  
A detailed example from the Delft team protocol will illustrate how  
CMs are related to the structure of cognitive activity, or reasoning, during  
a design search. A team of three experienced designers (John, Ivan, and  
Kerry — see the appendix) worked for two hours to design a rack to hold  
a given backpack, with a bedroll strapped to its bottom, which was to be  
attached to a given mountain bike. Linkographs of units 37, 38, and 39 of  
the team protocol (out of 45 units into which the protocol was divided) are  
used; the total duration of which is close to 10 minutes.

**Unit 37** Figure 5.3 is a linkograph of unit 37, a relatively long episode,  
comprising 62 moves (duration: five minutes). The subject matter of the  
team ’ s deliberations in this episode was the complete rack and its joints  
to the bicycle, with an emphasis on the rack ’ s structure. In the 15 minutes  
preceding this episode, the team had discussed features of the rack, the  
backpack that was to be fastened to it, and mounting points on the bicycle  
to which the rack could be attached. In unit 37 they took a more holistic  
view at the design components; at the end of this unit, they felt that the  
design was “ under control ” and it was time to finalize details. The linko-  
graph shows that the recorded episode is divided into three main phases:  
(1) moves 3 – 15 (preceded by two “ extracurricular ” moves, 1 and 2, in which  
the team checked its schedule), (2) moves 15 – 45, which describe a large  
chunk, and (3) from move 45 to the end. The linkograph shows graphically  
that moves 15 and 45 are “ pivots ” that end one phase and start another.  
The third phase is a compendium of three very small chunks (moves 45 – 52,  
moves 53 – 57, and moves 57 – 60\) and two final moves (61 and 62). Move  
62, which links back all the way to move 4, “ closed ” this unit before the  
team moved on to different subject matters in the next unit. Within the  
first and second phases we also distinguish smaller cohesive parts and webs  
of especially densely interlinked moves (e.g., moves 15 – 20 and moves  
30 – 35).

**82 Chapter 5**

Let us look at critical moves at a threshold of seven links. There are five  
such moves, one of them double-speared: 4 \> , 15 \> , 23 \> , \< 35 \> , and \< 43\. All  
the CM^7 s are located in the first two phases; there are none in the third  
phase. We should now like to take a close look at the positions these moves  
occupy in the sequence of moves. Move 4, which is near the beginning,  
brings up points related to the bedroll that is strapped to the backpack and  
how the rack ’ s frame is to accommodate it, to which other moves, in phases  
1 and 2, backlink later:

*Move 4 (John)* and and I guess if I had to express that someway, I would I  
would see it as being something like er \[sketches\] here ’ s the front of the  
frame and there ’ s the backpack sitting like this; oops I guess I ’ ve got that  
backwards, sorry, the frame went backwards now because we ’ re gonna have  
the bedroll off the back, so it ’ s probably open at the rear

The bedroll is not picked up in further moves of this phase, and the issue  
reaches no conclusion (however, there seems to be an implicit agreement  
on the point advanced in this move). Move 15, the last in this phase, refers  
to the frame, going back to an earlier proposal that describes it as being  
made of metal tubes:

**Figure 5.3**  
Linkograph of unit 37, Delft team protocol.

**Critical Moves 83**

*Move 15 (John)* and then Kerry ’ s got the, OK, we’ll assume Kerry ’ s tubes; or  
can it be a single tube now, can it just be like a tube that does this, that ’ s  
folded one time like this

The proposal to replace several thin tubes with one heavier and stronger  
tube elicited a discussion of the best structural solution. Eventually the next  
critical move was made. In that move, the issue of tubes was put aside tem-  
porarily and the properties of the rack to be placed on top of the tube frame  
(which the team had come to call the “ tray ” ) were discussed:

*Move 23 (John)* and this could just have little snaps to the er er, to these  
rails, so that to these tubes; so we have this folding down spec; so that  
if this junc\[tion\] point here had a pivot at it and and then it ’ s kinda like  
you ’ re folding TV trays; you just unclip this guy from here and you unclip,  
well you probably don ’ t need to unclip the back one, you just unclip one of  
these and then you can swing the legs flat

The ensuing discussion addressed the foldability requirement, which the  
team ’ s members had overlooked thus far and to which they now had to  
find a solution. In move 35 the discussion returned to the tubes, and a  
single-tube solution that appeared to be optimal was chosen:

*Move 35 (Ivan)* or look, they went with the \[looking at existing designs that  
were provided to the team\]; if you go with the big fat tube instead of that  
little skinny stuff you could probably get away with one tube and then you  
just do the same concept that they ’ ve done there

The design of the tube structure remained a major issue, as it determined  
possible geometries of the solution as well as the weight of the entire device

* an important consideration. Move 43 finalized the tube deliberations and  
  confirmed that the best solution was one “ beefy ” tube:

*Move 43 (John)* by just making that \[tube\] beefy enough

Having come up with a satisfactory solution to the structural issue, the  
team went on to discuss joints among components of the system, easy  
mounting and release of the rack, and the possibility of locking the rack  
to guard against theft. These were simpler and easier issues for the team;  
decisions were made quickly, and the discussion did not yield any critical  
moves.  
Upon inspecting the linkograph, we discover that the positions of the  
critical moves are not random. They occur primarily around the beginnings

**84 Chapter 5**

and endings of bigger and smaller chunks of interrelated moves, with CMs \>  
at beginnings and \< CMs at endings. Indeed, with the exception of move 43  
and move 35 (which is critical in both directions), all CMs have a forelink-  
ing orientation and reside at beginnings of chunks, or even entire phases  
of the design. This is a little harder to discern in the case of moves 23 and  
35, which occur in a larger structural unit spanning the whole of phase 2  
(moves 15 – 45). However, on careful examination we see that this stretch of  
moves can be broken down into smaller groups (moves 15 – 20 and moves  
30 – 35 were already singled out as discernible groups). We cannot fail to  
see that move 23 is one of only two moves connecting phase 2 to phase 1\.  
The other is move 21, which also connects phase 2 to phase 3\. But move  
21 addresses the manufacturing of the “ tray, ” a theme that was taken  
up in depth elsewhere in the process and received almost no attention in  
this unit.^4  
Move 43 occurs near the end of a small chunk (moves 35 – 43\) that is not  
very independent structurally, and which is close to the end of phase 2\. The  
other backlinking CM, move 35 (which is double-speared), is likewise at the  
end of a smaller and not easily distinguishable chunk, but it also introduces  
the next chunk (to which it has forelinks).  
This pattern is logically explainable. The moves in every group of densely  
interlinked moves (the density varies, of course) have some content in com-  
mon; otherwise there would not be a significant number of links among  
them. Therefore it is logical that many subsequent moves link back to one  
of the first moves that introduce the thematic content in that particular  
group of moves. Likewise, by the same logic, the last move to deal with  
that content before the design process turns to other issues links back to  
the largest number of former moves that partook in the discussions in a  
particular chunk or phase. Because design processes are not entirely “ pure ”  
or logical, we do not always observe the pattern we are describing here, and  
sometimes the pattern is discernible but incomplete and weak. However,  
in linkographs of well-structured episodes we can often observe the CM  
positioning at beginnings and endings of webs, chunks, phases, and entire  
units, with double-headed CMs occupying a special place in the resultant  
pattern (also see decision 19 in the Wang-Habraken process, illustrated in  
figure 5.2).  
When we lower the CM threshold, we get more CMs. This allows for a  
finer analysis. For example, if we choose CM^6 for Unit 37, the number of

**Critical Moves 85**

CMs goes up from five at CM^7 to thirteen, distributed throughout all three  
phases: 4 \> , 6 \> , \< 13, 15 \> , 16 \> , 23 \> , 30 \> , \< 35 \> , \< 42, \< 43, \< 45, \< 52, \< 62\. At  
this level the number of \< CMs and the number of CMs \> are equal; with  
one exception, we find only CMs \> up to the double-speared move 35, after  
which all critical moves are \< CMs. The exception is move 13, a \< CM that,  
together with moves 4 and 5 (both CMs \> ), “ frames ” phase 1\. Thus, we see  
that the structure of reasoning is captured by the location of critical moves  
at this level too. In this highly ordered unit, the correspondence between  
structure and the location of CMs is visibly perceivable in the linkograph.  
Linkographs of episodes in which we find no or very few CMs (at a rea-  
sonable threshold) can be assumed to have a poor structure, in addition to  
possibly being non-conclusive and devoid of important decisions. Some-  
times we find CMs at locations for which there is no logical account; in  
such cases the reason may be many repetitions that contribute little to the  
process but produce CMs at “ non-strategic ” locations. The linkographs of  
units 38 and 39 of the same Delft team protocol, directly following unit 37,  
are shown in figures 5.4 and 5.5 respectively. Comparable in length and in  
number of links, they will serve to illustrate the difference between a poorly  
structured pattern of reasoning and a relatively well-structured one.

**Unit 38** After the tray concept had been well established, in unit 38 the  
team was looking at how the backpack was to be fastened to the tray and  
what implications this might have for the tray ’ s properties ( figure 5.4 ). The  
team members compared the joining options of snaps, straps, and draw-  
strings; these devices were very familiar to the team, and there was no need  
for lengthy discussions. However, no agreement was reached, and the unit  
ended with the following two moves:

*Move 28 (John)* are we designing three different things \[three different fas-  
tening devices\]

*Move 29 (Kerry)* no we ’ re designing one thing

The unit can be divided into two phases: from the beginning to move  
22, and from move 21 to the end, subdivided into two small groups of  
moves (21 – 25 and 26 – 29). Move 21 is a pivot move that connects the two  
phases. Moves 26 – 29, which interlink only among themselves, are a kind  
of add-on to this unit ’ s deliberations. No immediately discernible struc-  
ture is revealed, but less well-defined structures may include the groups of

**86 Chapter 5**

moves 2 – 11, moves 4 – 17, and moves 12 – 21\. Two small webs exist, between  
moves 9 – 13 and moves 15 – 19\. Critical moves can be established only up  
to the threshold of five (in a short sequence such as this one, especially if  
we deduct moves 26 – 29, this is a reasonable threshold), at which we have  
three CMs: 15 \> , \< 17, and \< 21\. Move 15 is at the head of a web, move 17 is  
at the tail of a group, and moves 21 and 22 close the first phase. All of these  
are strategic points, albeit weak ones. If we lower the threshold to 4, we get  
many more critical moves. The most noticeable feature at this level is the  
double criticality of move 21, which is now critical owing to its links in  
both directions, a feature that is found almost exclusively in pivot moves.  
However, move 10 is also double-speared, although it does not have a simi-  
lar distinguished pivot position in the sequence of moves. Move 9 is at the  
head of one of the webs, and move 19 is at the tail of the other web. The  
rest of the CM^4 s in this sequence do not occupy strategic positions. The lack  
of clear grouping and the inconclusive positioning of several CMs in this  
sequence lead to the conclusion that this unit is poorly structured.

**Unit 39** By contrast with unit 38, we can read structure into unit 39 ( figure  
5.5 ), which is dedicated to establishing the tray ’ s dimensions. The unit is

**Figure 5.4**  
Linkograph of unit 38, Delft team protocol.

**Critical Moves 87**

divided into poorly structured activity during moves 1 – 13 and adequately  
structured activity from move 13 to the end, with a web embedded in this  
phase (moves 15 – 20). Although the unit is short, there are five CM^6 s, of  
which three are CMs \> at the beginning of phase 2, and two are \< CMs at  
its end. The discussion in the second phase was highly focused, and deci-  
sions regarding the tray ’ s dimensions were reached. The discourse is well  
captured by the CMs — for example, the first and the last (a CM \> and a \< CM  
respectively):

*Move 13 (John)* OK let ’ s draw fifteen inches OK, and it ’ s probably, what, two  
inches deep

*Move 31 (Ivan)* I think you ’ re two inches over the \[tray length\]

Units 38 and 39, despite their similarity in terms of number of moves  
and links, are very different in terms of structure, and this is revealed in the  
existence or lack thereof of critical moves at an elevated threshold and the  
positioning of critical moves in the string of moves. For an overview of link  
statistics pertaining to units 37 – 39, and for averages for a larger sample (14  
units totaling 624 moves), see table 5.3.  
We see that unit 37 has the highest values of all variables among  
the three units surveyed (although they are lower than the average of the

**Figure 5.5**  
Linkograph of unit 39, Delft team protocol.

**88 Chapter 5**

larger sample in some of the parameters). The link index and notably the  
percentage of CM^6 s are higher than the average, which appears to be posi-  
tively correlated with the structured reasoning in unit 37\.  
Next let us consider two bolder hypotheses: that critical moves are indic-  
ative of the quality of design processes and that they can help us under-  
stand the dynamics of a design team. To do so, we shall look at critical  
moves differentially, as it is claimed that \< CMs and CMs \> have different  
roles. We shall begin by looking at the number of links generated by these  
two types of critical moves.

**Process Productivity and Balance between** \< **CMs and CMs** \>

Gestalt psychologists distinguished between reproductive and productive  
problem solving (Wertheimer 1945/1971). The former refers to processes  
for which problem solvers can reproduce routines that are familiar to them  
from successful solutions to earlier problems. If the current problem is not  
novel and resembles problems encountered in the past, reproduction is suf-  
ficient to yield a solution to the current problem. However, if the pres-  
ent problem is novel and does not resemble previously solved problems  
in any substantial manner, and a novel solution is sought, reproductive  
processes are not sufficient. The problem solver must then engage in a pro-  
ductive problem-solving process that entails restructuring the problem so  
that he or she can get a handle on it. Max Wertheimer coined the term  
“ productive thinking, ” by which he meant the kind of thinking that people  
demonstrate when coming up with novel solutions to problems. Follow-  
ing in Wertheimer ’ s footsteps, the term *productive designing* is introduced.  
Since most design problems are ill-defined and ill-structured, and therefore  
novel, designers have to engage in productive processes in order to arrive  
at solutions. It is maintained that design productivity is reflected in the

**Table 5.3**  
Link statistics, units 37, 38, and 39\. Delft team protocols.

**Critical Moves 89**

structure that can be observed in a linkograph. The balance between \< CMs  
and CMs \> is also very telling.  
Three design episodes, involving the architects Gilbert, Gideon, and  
Glenda, are used to qualitatively investigate the productivity of their pro-  
cesses in a design task. They are taken from the MIT “ branch library ” exper-  
iment, in which architects were given an outline of a small library building  
(referred to as a “ footprint ” ) and were asked to comment on how different  
entry options affected the building ’ s design (see the appendix). These epi-  
sodes were chosen because of the considerable differences in the extent to  
which they achieved design solutions.

**Gilbert**  
Gilbert had difficulty with the very ambiguous task, and contented himself  
with offering lengthy commentary on its various aspects. (The problem he  
tackled was “ branch library II, ” a variation on the original “ branch library ”  
task. See the appendix.) Preoccupied with what were described as existing  
walls in the library site, he studied every aspect of them in order to decide  
whether, and how, they could be incorporated into the library ’ s design.  
Not considering it necessary to arrive at a decisive solution, he opted for an  
analytic approach that he took to be more appropriate.  
The linkograph drawn for Gilbert ( figure 5.6 ) spans 63 moves, with 53  
links interconnecting them. Although two overlapping phases are discern-  
ible (moves 1 – 35 and moves 28 – 63), the linkograph does not suggest a very  
clear structure — and achieving a clear structure would be difficult with so  
low a number of links. Note, too, that there is only one critical move at the  
level chosen for this study, namely a threshold of at least four links; this is  
move 3, a lengthy move in which Gilbert first considered pros and cons of  
using the existing walls:

*Move 3* My sense would be that we could build on top of the walls. You  
could say that you have so much of the wall started, let ’ s build on top of it  
and go with that. My sense would be that would not be a good decision to  
make for several reasons. One, you don ’ t know about the actual structural  
integrity of the walls. So let ’ s not do that. Two, no matter what we do, it ’ s  
never going to match. If the wall has been built for some period of time,  
when we come in and stack new stuff on it, it isn ’ t going to match even if  
we had the exact same builder. Plus, when you take a wall that ’ s 2 ’ 6 ” high  
and 20 feet long, it ’ s like “ Why bother? ”

**90 Chapter 5**

Later the walls led to the establishment of a grid that was to become the  
foundation of the library design, but Gilbert was satisfied with a lengthy  
analysis and did not actively engage is arriving at a design solution.  
The low performance indicators appear to reflect Gilbert ’ s interpretation  
of his role, which yielded loosely interlinked bits of commentary that were  
not integrated into a whole.

**Gideon**  
Gideon, a practicing architect, was oriented toward solutions, probably as  
a result of his daily experience in practice. Like Gilbert, Gideon was pre-  
sented with the “ Library II ” task. The library he imagined was a simple  
wooden structure with a hearth and a prominent chimney. The space  
within the library would be flooded with light coming through a glass wall  
and through windows in the roof (skylights).  
The linkograph of an episode from his process, shown here in figure  
5.7 , includes 64 moves — one more move than Gilbert ’ s episode. However,  
Gideon ’ s moves are interconnected with a much larger number of links:

80. There is also a fair number of critical moves, eight of them at the level  
    of CM^4. Structurally, however, Gideon ’ s linkograph does not offer more

**Figure 5.6**  
Linkograph of episode from Gilbert ’ s design process, branch library design exercise.

**Critical Moves 91**

clarity than Gilbert ’ s, and well-defined groupings of highly interlinked  
moves cannot be discerned.^5 The fact that all the critical moves other than  
the last are CMs \> tells us that Gideon kept advancing new ideas, but there  
is no evidence that they resulted in firm decisions before the process moved  
on to new concerns. An exception is move 18, to which the sole \< CM in  
the linkograph (move 57\) backlinks. Move 18 is interesting because at a  
lower level (CM^3 ) it is critical in both directions, thus having a bit more of  
a structural role in the process:

*Move 18* We don ’ t know which direction the building is going yet, but I  
would place the hearth first as way of organizing the rest of the idea and  
the plan.

Gideon repeated the main ideas several times, and reworked them; as a  
result, quite a number of links in his linkograph stem from repetitions of  
similar thoughts. This may explain the relatively poor structure of the pro-  
cess as revealed by the linkograph, despite the many links and critical moves.

**Glenda**  
In the episode analyzed, Glenda ’ s process was highly structured. It com-  
prised 50 moves with 80 links among them — the same number of links as

**Figure 5.7**  
Linkograph of episode from Gideon ’ s design process, branch library design exercise.

**92 Chapter 5**

in Gideon ’ s case, but in a shorter stretch of moves. The linkograph ( fig-  
ure 5.8 ) shows a clear division into two phases: moves 1 – 36 and moves  
35 – 60\. There are a number of small, dense hunks of links that fail to qualify  
as webs because they are too small (1 – 4, 15 – 19, 32 – 35, 42 – 45). There are  
nine CM^4 s that are almost equally divided between CMs \> (four moves) and  
\< CMs (five moves).  
In this episode, Glenda took a very solution-oriented approach to the  
task and advanced an idea that emerged after she had imagined a slightly  
different setting for the library — an urban rather than a suburban one. She  
assumed that the library would be enclosed by two party walls in a row of  
contiguous structures. Having drawn the library ’ s footprint between these  
walls, she made the following move:

*Move 38* and my first inclination is to divide it \[the given layout\] into nine  
squares. The nine-square configuration is classic

She provided some explanation to the nine-square (3 × 3\) choice, talking  
about its prominence in classical urban design. Then she made the follow-  
ing three consecutive moves:

*Move 40* So now these are what I ’ ll call solids, that ’ s built area, and these

Ideas in this episode referred to various planning and architectural prec-  
edents, including the traditional North African Kasbah structure and the  
well-known prototypical house plans suggested by Serge Chermayeff and  
Christopher Alexander (1965). Glenda ’ s moves in this brief vignette were  
very “ designerly ” (to use Nigel Cross ’ word; see Cross 2006): she reframed  
the problem (from a suburban to an urban context) and made transforma-  
tions in her emerging conceptual solution as needed. Because the classic  
nine squares did not work, she accepted a twelve-square variation on the  
theme as satisfactory. The episode is productive in that a solution is in fact  
created and put forth and in that the process conforms to the Gestalt defini-  
tion of productive thinking.  
Table 5.4 summarizes a few parameters related to moves and links for the  
three episodes we have looked at. Clearly, Glenda emerges as the designer  
with the highest scores for these parameters: her link index is nearly twice  
that of Gilbert, and the percentage of CMs in her episode is more than  
tenfold compared to the percentage of CMs in Gilbert ’ s episode. She also  
has a good balance between critical moves in the two directions, which will  
be addressed in the next section. Gideon ’ s scores are somewhere between  
Gilbert ’ s and Glenda ’ s.

**Balance between** \< **CMs and CMs** \>

The balance between \< CMs and CMs \> is of particular importance. Gideon  
and Gilbert generate only, or almost only, CMs \> , which suggests that they  
come up with ideas but do not bring them to fruition, in the sense that they

are not developed, evaluated, or summarized. In Glenda ’ s case the propor-  
tion of the two types of CMs is almost equal, suggesting balanced cycles of  
idea generation and assessment toward a solution. The quantitative results,  
although pertaining to partial episodes only, confirm an expert ’ s unbi-  
ased observation and assessment of the productivity of the three designers  
throughout the design sessions.  
We return now to the highly productive Delft workshop designers –  
the individual as well as the team. Like Glenda, they have been shown  
to reach balanced proportions of \< CMs and CMs \> , as shown in table 5.5.  
It so happens that the proportion of 43 percent \< CMs versus 57 percent  
CMs \> is identical for both the individual designer and the team. They have  
also attained almost similar link indices, with no statistically significant  
difference between the two processes (five units each, 21 and 25 minutes  
respectively).  
A balanced proportion of critical moves in both directions suggests  
that ideas that are brought up are pursued and inspected, and conclusions  
(positive or negative) regarding their appropriateness and utility are drawn  
before the designer moves on. This is a hallmark of expertise: no time or  
effort is wasted on ideas that cannot be followed. At the same time, no  
ideas that are brought up are abandoned without undergoing at least some  
exploration.  
The link index can tell us at least something about design productivity,  
but records of the critical moves in both directions can tell us more.

**Backlinks and Forelinks of Critical Moves**

As has been demonstrated, critical moves are of great significance in design  
thinking, and \< CMs and CMs \> occupy fairly well-defined positions in

linkographs, which in turn represent the process of design thinking and  
reasoning. It is time now to return to the claim (made in chapter 3\) that the  
design process aims at synthesizing a large number of issues into subsolu-  
tions and ultimately into one comprehensive solution.  
In chapter 3, attention was called to two modes of thinking that syn-  
thesizing entails — modes that can be equated to divergent thinking and  
convergent thinking. At the cognitive level at which we examine design  
processes, the two types of thinking must more or less co-exist if a fruitful  
process is to be maintained. To see what this means in linkography, let us  
look at the link patterns of critical moves.  
The way to explore this question is to look at all the links generated by  
critical moves — not only links in the direction that won them criticality  
(that is, either backward or forward), but also links in the opposite direc-  
tion. A CM \> may also have backlinks, and a \< CM may also have forelinks.  
What is the proportion of a CM ’ s links in each direction? A preliminary  
analysis that included five units from the Delft team protocol (32 – 37; units  
34 and 35 are grouped together) was carried out; the results are summarized  
in table 5.6. These units comprise 298 moves, of which 76 are CM^6 s — that  
is, each has at least six links backward, forward, or (in rare cases) in both  
directions.^6  
We see that in this sample, for both CMs \> and \< CMs, nearly three-  
fourths of the links are in the direction in which criticality was designated,  
but another one-fourth are in the opposite direction. As table 5.7 (which

represents a wider sample of cases extracted from various studies) shows, a  
stable proportion of links is maintained in the designated criticality direc-  
tion across cases, although this proportion reaches 80 percent rather than  
the 73 percent of the previous, more limited study.  
These results suggest that the intricate process of design reasoning is  
non-linear, in the sense that at least as far as significant (critical) design  
moves are concerned, every step is in fact double speared: it moves for-  
ward, but it also makes sure that it is congruent with what has already  
been achieved, and it validates what has been done thus far with an eye on  
ways to proceed from that point. Eighty percent of the effort is devoted to  
the “ major ” immediate goal; the remaining 20 percent is reserved for the  
“ minor ” companion goal.^7 It is proposed that this pattern represents a cog-  
nitive strategy that ensures the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning in  
designing: it safeguards continuity while also guaranteeing that progress is  
made, and it serves the need of sustaining a solid and comprehensive design  
rationale for the entity that is being designed. We take this to demonstrate  
the divergent-convergent thinking pattern that is a must in creative think-  
ing (see, e.g., Gabora 2010). The success of this cognitive strategy depends  
on an equilibrium between structure and content.

**Critical Moves 97**

**Structure-Content Relationship in Design Thinking**

In all the investigations that have been presented thus far, design moves  
were looked at only in terms of the links generated. Moves ’ contents served  
only to illustrate the kind of deliberations designers are engaged in while  
designing. Coding of moves was avoided for the most part. However, design  
moves differ, and if we wish to relate structure and content in design rea-  
soning, moves must be coded. A variety of coding schemes may be used  
for this purpose. The present study, which attempts to examine this rela-  
tionship, pertains to a subset of the Delft team protocols (units 32 – 37, 298  
moves, 21 minutes), and the moves under scrutiny are only those identified  
as CM^6 s. At the outset the links that serve to establish critical moves are  
determined on the basis of the moves ’ contents, but no coding is involved  
in establishing CMs (for a detailed presentation of this study, see Gold-  
schmidt and Weil 1998).  
First a coding scheme should be established, and the moves must be  
encoded accordingly regardless of any links they may have. If this scheme  
pertains to structural properties of design reasoning, linkography should  
make it possible to correlate data regarding structure with data regarding  
content. For the purpose of analyzing structure, a coding scheme pertain-  
ing to categories of designer activities was developed. The scheme is context  
independent and problem independent; it is akin to one of the classifica-  
tion schemes of Purcell et al. (1996).  
The coding scheme (CS) called *designer activity* comprises three major cat-  
egories, A, B, and C, the first of which is subdivided into five subcategories, as  
follows. (Subcategories A 2 – A 4 were grouped together for the sake of a clearer  
analysis.)

A — *Search and development*

A 1 — Proposal dealing with function or performance  
A 2 — Clarification of functional aspects  
A 3 — Analysis (of function or performance)  
A 4 — Explanation (of function or performance)  
A 5 — Assessment or evaluation (of function or performance)

B — *Support* of/ *reference* to previously expressed idea(s)

C — *Remarks* (agenda; jokes; miscellaneous)

**98 Chapter 5**

These categories are considered to be structural because they are indepen-  
dent of variables pertaining to subject matter, task definition and scope,  
and working style. In this design episode the functional performance of the  
entity that is being designed (a bicycle rack) is predominant in the design  
process, but the categories also hold for cases in which other factors might  
be of greater importance. For example, appearance and aesthetic consider-  
ations may be overriding in graphic design assignments. It may be argued  
that in such cases it is the *function* of the designed product (say, a poster)  
to attract attention. Therefore, the above categories are seen as a generic  
*structural* coding system for design moves.  
Using these structural categories, the critical moves in units 32 – 37 of  
the Delft team protocol were coded. Each CM was coded once or twice,  
according to the categories it reflects (because some moves received a dou-  
ble coding, on the average each move was coded into 1.06 categories). Table  
5.8 presents the category distribution for CM^6 s as derived from the linko-  
graphic analysis.

**Hypotheses**

The following hypotheses are based on the assumption that there is a rela-  
tionship, indeed a correlation, between properties of structure and proper-  
ties of content in design reasoning and these properties are reflected in the  
protocol. Two hypotheses relate to \< CMs and CMs \> , respectively.

a. The discrepancy between the number of nominal CMs and the total number of  
coded CMs is due to the fact that some moves have a double coding and are there-  
fore counted twice. Likewise, \< CMs \> are counted twice.

**Critical Moves 99**

**Hypothesis 1** ( \< CMs)

The coding of \< CMs tends to pertain to one or more of the categories A 2 – A 5 ,  
B, and C. \< CMs do not tend to pertain to category A 1\.

**Hypothesis 2** (CMs \> )

The coding of CMs \> tends to pertain to one or more of the categories A 1 – A 4  
and C. CMs \> do not tend to pertain to categories A 5 and B.

It follows from these hypotheses that CMs \> and \< CMs have equal  
tendencies to pertain to categories A 2 – A 4 and C. For each hypothesis, every  
CM was marked \[+\] if it confirmed the hypothesis and \[ − \] if it did not.  
A \< CM \> received two marks, once as a \< CM and once as a CM \>. CMs with  
a double coding were marked \[+\] or \[ − \] if both instances either confirmed  
or disconfirmed the hypothesis; if one coding confirmed the hypothe-  
sis and the other did not, it was marked \[+/ − \]. In a final count, all \[+/ − \]  
marks were discarded. The final count is given in table 5.9. The counting  
method explains the differences between the values in table 5.8 and those  
in table 5.9.  
Next it was necessary to test whether the coding of each CM tends to  
pertain to specified categories and does not tend to pertain to others. If the  
overall tendency reaches a percentage above chance level (50 percent), the  
tendency is confirmed; otherwise it is not confirmed. For each hypothesis  
we calculated the percentage by dividing the total number of \< CMs and  
CMs \> that support or do not support the hypothesis (and therefore have  
received a \[+\] or a \[ – \]) by the total number of \< CMs or CMs \> , as given in

a. The discrepancy between the number of nominal CMs and the number of coded

counted twice. Likewise, \< CMs \> are counted twice. The differences between values  
in this table and in table 5.8 are related to the actions associated with the assign-  
ment of \+, – , and \+/ – marks.

tables 5.8 and 5.9. Thirty-five \< CMs and 41 CMs \> were thus tested, yielding  
the following results (note that this is the nominal number of CMs; see the  
notes to the tables):

**Hypothesis 1** ( \< CMs)

Hypothesis supported: (26/35) x 100 percent \= 74.3 percent. Hypothesis  
not supported: (8/35) x 100 percent \= 22.9 percent

**Hypothesis 2** (CMs \> )

Hypothesis supported: (28/41) x 100 percent \= 68.3 percent.

Hypothesis not supported: (8/41) x 100 percent \= 19.5 percent

The conclusion is that hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 are supported  
beyond the chance level ( *p* \< 0.05). The confirmation of the hypotheses  
suggests that in design reasoning structure and content are indeed corre-  
lated. One might argue that this is a trivial finding, since we obviously  
expect an evaluative move to deal with previous moves, not with future  
ones. Similarly, a new proposal has less to do with past moves and would,  
in all likelihood, be dealt with in subsequent design acts. However, as  
linkographic studies show, design reasoning is not that simple. We should  
remember that the definition of “ move ” pertains to a very small design out-  
put unit that, on the basis of content, can potentially generate a large num-  
ber of links. Every CM generates an average of ten links (in this example),  
but only some of them are in the “ designated ” direction (see the preced-  
ing section). Because “ content ” is determined by common sense, intricate  
backlinks and forelinks may be expected at what may be called a “ semantic  
level ” : it is sufficient for any common element to be present in two moves  
to potentially establish a link between them. Therefore, a move ’ s category/  
link-direction relationship is by no means obvious. In addition, the cor-  
relation that was established results from analyses of content and structure  
that are perpendicular to one another (that is, entirely independent), and  
therefore no circular or causal relationships exist between structure and  
content as defined here.  
The same experiment was repeated with a different coding scheme  
(Goldschmidt and Weil 1998\) wherein the categories were only partially  
structural, meaning that they were not entirely context independent. The  
categories were related to the level at which design actions were under-  
taken: the level of a holistic view of the entire entity being designed (in this

**Critical Moves 101**

case bicycle and rack), or the level of subsystems (bicycle only, rack only),  
or the level of details. The reason this scheme is not context independent  
has to do with the fact that in different design phases designers are likely  
to focus on different levels and therefore a study of an episode early in the  
design process would yield different results than a study of a much later epi-  
sode. Indeed, a hypothesis that related CMs \> to a holistic treatment of the  
entire system was not confirmed, probably because the protocol was taken  
from the middle of the second hour of a two-hour session.  
Jean Piaget (1971) and other structuralists who were dedicated to the  
discovery and explication of structure in thought and matter were highly  
aware of the complex relationship between structure, often equated with  
form in their writings, and content. Structuralism endeavored to reinte-  
grate content with form, and Piaget ’ s version of this proposed integration  
theorizes that content and form (structure) are nested hierarchically in a  
system, “ each element being ‘ content ’ relative to some prior element and  
‘ form ’ for some posterior element ” (ibid., 29). This notion assumes a trans-  
formational relationship between structure and content. I believe that in  
reasoning the relationship between the two does not have to be hierarchi-  
cal; rather, content and structure concurrently describe the state of a system  
at any given point and in effective reasoning they are apparently extremely  
well coordinated. I hope to have demonstrated that, at least in design rea-  
soning, this is indeed the case, and the proof rests with the properties of  
critical moves.

**Studio Ideas Revisited**

Dan Tatsa (see appendix and earlier in this chapter) found a correlation  
between independent linkographic counts of critical ideas and ideas that  
students assessed as important to their own designs. Let us return to the  
design studio and look at students ’ ideas from a slightly different perspec-  
tive. Hagay Hochman and Itay Dafni (see appendix and Goldschmidt  
et al. 2010\) were interested in “ desk crits ” (critiques) in the studio and the  
“ ownership ” of issues and ideas that emerge in this setting. The desk crit  
is the most prevalent practical instructional setting in schools of all design  
disciplines; this particular case looks at an architectural design studio. Stu-  
dents meet with their teachers in the studio regularly (two or three times a  
week) to present the progress they have made on their projects and receive

**102 Chapter 5**

feedback from the teacher. The communication between the teacher and  
the student is a conversation based on the student ’ s materials (drawings,  
models, etc.) that is often accompanied by sketching. The duration of a crit  
ranges from 10 minutes to nearly an hour. Hochman and Dafni recorded  
three desk crits in three different studios of second-year students. The  
names of the students were Mani, Alona, and Yoav.  
After producing protocols of the three crits, Hochman and Dafni gener-  
ated linkographs. They did so in two stages. In stage 1 they produced full  
linkographs in which they notated links between all verbalizations of the  
two parties (student and teacher). In stage 2 they erased from the linko-  
graphs all links between verbalizations by the same party — that is, a stu-  
dent ’ s link to his or her own former verbalization, and a teacher ’ s link to  
his or her own previous verbalization. The new partial linkographs (particu-  
larly the one for Yoav ’ s crit) were much less dense. Figures 5.9 – 5.11 show  
the two linkographs — one full, one partial — for each of the three crits.  
Next, Hochman and Dafni singled out critical moves (verbalizations) at  
the level of three links. They chose a low threshold in order to have a suf-  
ficiently large number of moves to point to actual trends. They focused  
on CMs \> , because they were interested in moves that raise new issues that  
elicit subsequent discussion. Because they knew who had generated each  
move, they could count the number of CM^3 s \> by each of the parties for  
each crit. Table 5.10 shows these counts, expressed as nominal numbers  
and proportions, after discarding a few moves at the outset of each crit;  
these moves occurred during the students ’ introductory presentations,  
before the conversation had actually begun. The rightmost column shows  
the results without those introductory moves discarded. Regardless of the  
number of verbalizations, in all cases the teachers emerge as having made  
a higher proportion of CMs \> , with the exception of Alona ’ s crit before the  
deduction of introductory moves, wherein the proportion is almost equal.  
This confirms that critical verbalizations in which new issues or ideas are  
raised are more often made by teachers than by students. The participants  
in this experiment, students and teachers alike, were not aware of this anal-  
ysis. Hochman and Dafni wanted to know what their perception was of  
who raises issues in crits: Did they know that issues were raised mostly by  
the teachers? To find out, they used a brief questionnaire in which one of  
the questions was “ Who normally brings up issues in crits? ” The students  
and the teachers were asked to rate, on a scale of 1 – 5, the frequency with

which issues were raised by students and by teachers. Table 5.11 shows the  
responses.  
Mani and Alona thought that they raised most new issues in their crits,  
but their teachers did not think so. Mani ’ s teacher thought that he raised  
most issues, a perception that is corroborated by the findings in table 5.10.  
Alona ’ s teacher felt that he and the student raised an equal number of  
issues; that is true if we count Alona ’ s introductory moves in the analyzed  
session, but if we deduct those moves the teacher raised almost twice as

many issues as Alona. Yoav thought that he and the teacher were even in  
raising issues, whereas his teacher correctly estimated that it was he who  
raised more issues, which is also what the empirical results in table 5.10 tell  
us. These results suggest that teachers are better than students at assessing  
their respective contributions to raising issues and ideas in crits. A study of  
CMs \> gives us an accurate picture, whereas a self-assessment can be biased  
and misleading. Students tend to appropriate ideas proposed by teachers  
and to think of them as their own.  
In a study of eight students, Tatsa — using records based on his observa-  
tions of the party that generated ideas for each project, and the students ’  
assessments of who had generated them — found similar tendencies (Gold-  
schmidt and Tatsa 2005). Many of the students thought the teacher ’ s ideas  
were their own. These interesting findings suggest that the teachers in ques-  
tion were good pedagogues, in that they allowed the students to appropri-  
ate ideas without insisting on their ownership. They also suggest that the  
students were learners: it is much easier to learn if one can relate to ideas  
as one ’ s own, especially in creative disciplines in which students are very  
sensitive to the ownership of ideas. Many students resent using the ideas  
of others (especially teachers), although most of them know that there are  
advantages in adopting ideas and relating to issues raised by a teacher. It  
is therefore an indication of good teaching skills that a teacher is able to  
raise issues in such a way that a student is able to appropriate them and  
to experiment with them in his or her design work. However, if we want to  
know what has really occurred, linkography and especially critical moves  
give us an unbiased picture.

**Critical Moves and Team Dynamics**

We now return to the Delft team protocols (units 32 – 37, 21 minutes, 298  
moves), but this time we shall look at the individual designers who are  
the team ’ s members: Kerry, Ivan, and John, three experienced industrial  
designers who work together in real life.  
Teamwork has been studied from many perspectives. Here the modest  
goal is to look at the contributions of the three members to the “ move  
economy ” of the process. We should keep in mind that this team is uni-  
disciplinary, as the members are designers of equal standing who are  
working together to design a backpack carrier for a bicycle. Their relative

**108 Chapter 5**

contributions were examined by looking at the critical moves they achieved  
at two levels, CM^6 and CM^7 , while distinguishing between \< CMs and CMs \>.  
Table 5.12 summarizes the count of these moves, expressed as proportions.  
The first thing we notice is that the three designers were not equally  
active. They made different numbers of moves, John leading the way with  
38 percent of all moves. This suggests that we have no reason to expect  
a uniform contribution of critical moves by the team ’ s members, either.  
There can be many reasons for uneven performance — expertise and inter-  
est in the subject matter, personality traits and dispositions, social circum-  
stances, distractions, and so on. In this case, Kerry, the only woman on the  
team, appeared at times to be uneasy. At one point, after being teased by  
her teammates, she even said (jokingly) “ Help\! I want out of this exercise. ”  
Nigel Cross and Anita Clayburn Cross (1995), who analyzed the same pro-  
tocol from the point of view of social dynamics, went as far as to suggest  
that Kerry had been intimidated by the two male designers. This may have  
been the reason for her somewhat lower performance in this session, but of  
course there could have been other reasons. Needless to say, it is normal to  
find differences among the contributions of a team ’ s members. Contribu-  
tions may change from phase to phase of a process and, of course, from one  
project to another. Therefore, we chose to look at contributions only to the  
critical moves that were generated in this vignette, and a comparison of  
contributions at two threshold levels is very telling of the team ’ s dynamics.  
At the level of CM^7 , John was clearly the chief contributor. He generated  
more CM^7 s than his share in the general move count — 43 percent, versus  
38 percent in the general move count. Many of his CM^7 s had a backlink-  
ing orientation — he generated nearly half of the \< CM^7 s. Kerry was respon-  
sible for only one-third of the CM^7 s, still slightly higher than her share  
in the general move count. She generated more \< CM^7 s than CM^7 s \>. Ivan,

**Critical Moves 109**

who generated 32 percent of the moves, contributed only one-fourth of the  
CM^7 s, mostly CM^7 s \>. What do these numbers reveal?  
John and Kerry, who generated mostly \< CM^7 s, albeit in different pro-  
portions, seemed to be assessing and reinforcing previous moves, perhaps  
solidifying design decisions after discussion. In Kerry ’ s case, this happened  
especially in one of the protocol units in which technical details of joinery  
of the rack to the bicycle frame were discussed. Kerry is an experienced  
cyclist, and in that unit John said “ we can assume Kerry has expert knowl-  
edge. ” Ivan, on the other hand, made many more CM^7 s \> than \< CM^7 s —  
almost twice as many, and the proportion is not far from John ’ s CM^7 s \>. We  
interpret this to mean that Ivan was less inclined than the others to look  
back at what had already been thoroughly discussed in order to declare,  
and perhaps repeat, a decision or an assertion. He was more preoccupied  
with raising new ideas and questions, and this was reflected in his high  
proportion of CM^7 s \>. This manner of performance in the team, or design  
behavior, may be a result of personality traits or a perception of his role on  
the team. Ivan was the appointed “ timekeeper ” in this design process; he  
adhered to a timetable for design phases that the team established at the  
outset of the process and made sure the team progresses as planned.  
At the level of CM^6 s, the picture looks different. At that level, Ivan was  
the designer who contributed the highest proportion of critical moves: 37  
percent, slightly higher than John and considerably more than his share in  
the general move count. Kerry again contributed the least — slightly more  
than one-fourth of the CM^6 s. Both Kerry and John contributed slightly  
lower proportions of CM^6 s than their share in the general move count.  
When we look at the distribution of \< CM^6 s and CM^6 s \> , the picture sharp-  
ens. Ivan made far more CM^6 s \> than his teammates — nearly one-half, as  
opposed to one-third by John and less than one-fourth by Kerry. This was  
at the expense of \< CM^6 s, in which Ivan trailed behind John and Kerry, who  
contributed an almost equal proportion of backlinking critical moves (John  
slightly more than Kerry). The trend here highlights what we saw at the  
higher level of CM^7. Ivan was very active in making new proposals, in ini-  
tiating discussion topics, in asking important questions, to which the team  
reacted subsequently. He may have felt less of a need to sum up, repeat, or  
finalize decisions. John may have felt that he was the leader and that he  
should have the final say, which is reflected at the CM^7 level; Ivan did not  
share this sentiment.

**110 Chapter 5**

A basketball team ’ s goal is to score by shooting the ball through the  
net. Yet not all players try to shoot at all times; rather, they have roles,  
and often a player ’ s best moves are those in which he or she passes to  
the player who is, at the moment, best positioned to shoot and score. The  
member of our design team whose (probably unofficial) role was to “ score ”  
was John, who “ sealed ” decisions while also making many new suggestions  
(for example, he was the one who first suggested the “ tray ” concept for  
the rack — a concept that, from the moment it was suggested, became the  
basis for a complete design solution). Ivan may have seen himself more as a  
shooting guard, whose role it was to let John score — in this case, to exclaim  
the punch line that occurs at a higher threshold level of move criticality  
(CM^7 ). Kerry ’ s role in this session was less clear. She may have seen herself  
as contributing mainly detailed technical expertise, but in this session the  
opportunity to do so was limited by the conceptual nature of the task and  
by the time frame.

In the various cases presented in this chapter, we saw that with almost no  
background information about the designers and the particulars of the task  
and the design process, critical moves can tell us a fascinating story about  
what transpired in a design event. If we compare critical moves at different  
levels or between designers, we can penetrate even deeper into the situa-  
tion. This further strengthens our belief that linkography in general and  
critical moves in particular are a very useful approach to the analysis of  
design thinking and processes.

## 6 Design Creativity

Creativity is a many-faceted phenomenon that is being researched from  
various perspectives in several fields. At the dawn of the era of cognitive  
psychology and cognitive science, Arthur Koestler (1964) was among  
the first authors to expose the complexity of creativity. Quite naturally,  
much of the relevant research is carried out in these fields. It is impos-  
sible to find a single definition of creativity that everyone agrees with, and  
most researchers prefer to avoid defining it (something that is not neces-  
sary for the purpose of discussing creativity). In fact, it is tenable to claim  
that there is no such thing as creativity, that there are only manifestations  
of it.^1 The literature on creativity is vast; here, let us content ourselves  
with the presentation of a few relevant principles before we turn to design  
creativity.

**Creativity Research**

The following five perspectives on creativity research are of the essence.

**Magnitude of impact**  
Creative breakthroughs vary in impact. Margaret Boden distinguished  
between psychological creativity (P-Creativity) and historical creativity  
(H-Creativity), defining them as follows:

A valuable idea is P-creative if the person in whose mind it arises could not have had  
it before; it does not matter how many times before other people have already had  
the same idea. By contrast, a valuable idea is H-creative if it is P-creative *and* no one  
else, in all human history, has ever had it before. (1994, 76\)

Obviously there are many more instances of P-creativity than of H-  
creativity, although society is more concerned with instances of H-creativity

**112 Chapter 6**

that affect the lives of most of us. Radical breakthroughs under H-creativity  
include great works of art, important scientific discoveries and techno-  
logical inventions, and influential social reforms with long-lasting effects.  
However, P-creativity is important to all of us in our daily lives; we value it  
and try to augment it in various ways. The discussion of design creativity in  
this chapter has P-creativity in mind.

**Mode of manifestation**  
Since creativity as an abstract notion is elusive, most researchers prefer to  
study creative phenomena. One distinction that many researchers make  
was suggested by Howard Gardner (1988), who referred to the creative  
product, the creative person, and the creative process. Some researchers —  
among them Teresa Amabile (1983) — add the creative environment, by  
which they mean a social environment that fosters creativity.  
A creative product, tangible or not, is usually acknowledged as a creative  
product only if it is both novel (original) and functional (useful), and if it  
is accepted as creative by the community, which may be quite small in the  
case of P-creativity and very extensive in the case of H-creativity. The most  
common method of assessing the creativity of products is judgment by  
experts. Most published research on design creativity treats creative prod-  
ucts, often artifacts with enormous social, technological, and/or cultural  
influence.  
The creative person has been studied mostly by means of case studies  
of individuals with extraordinary achievements and in rare cases also by  
attempting to profile creativity in terms of personality traits. Donald Mac-  
Kinnon (1962) tried to find personality correlates of creativity among Amer-  
ican architects by subjecting three groups of 40 architects each to a battery  
of personality tests. One group consisted of “ most creative ” architects, one  
of “ creative ” architects, and one of “ regular ” architects. Individual archi-  
tects were assigned to these groups on the basis of a number of criteria,  
some of which may not be considered appropriate today. On page 3 of his  
1978 book *In Search of Human Effectiveness* , MacKinnon wrote:

To summarize, what is most generally characteristic of the creative architect... is  
his high level of effective intelligence, his openness to experience, his freedom from  
petty restraints and impoverishing inhibitions, his aesthetic sensitivity, his cogni-  
tive flexibility, his independence in thought and action, his high level of energy,  
his unquestioning commitment to creative endeavor and his unceasing striving for

**Design Creativity 113**

creative solutions to the ever more difficult architectural problems which he con-  
stantly sets for himself.

The creative process is difficult to capture and difficult to study. There  
are a lot of assumptions regarding the properties of creative processes that  
led to the development of methods and techniques aimed at enhancing  
creativity in individuals and teams (e.g., brainstorming and TRIZ).  
The subfield of design for which the most creativity-enhancing meth-  
ods have been developed is engineering design. Behavioral studies are con-  
ducted in the laboratory and usually investigate design behavior — mostly  
problem solving; the problem and the experimental design usually are  
designed to test hypotheses, which are inferred from models of creative  
thinking. For example, analogical reasoning is assumed to be an important  
cognitive strategy in support of creativity, as it builds on abstracting the  
problem and thereby makes it easier to push the boundaries of the solution  
search space. In one study of the use of visual analogy in design, partici-  
pants were asked to solve design problems under different conditions (with  
and without visual stimuli, and with and without instructions to use analo-  
gies based on such stimuli). Their designs were scored for creativity by naive  
expert judges; the scores were then assessed in light of hypotheses regard-  
ing the conditions that would yield the most creative designs (Casakin and  
Goldschmidt 2000). Protocol analysis is often used in such studies. In this  
chapter we shall look at creativity in the design process rather than at cre-  
ativity in the design product or in the designer ’ s personality.

**Case studies of prominent creative people and products**  
Biographers and researchers have attempted to explain the extraordinary  
achievements of extremely creative individuals by tracing the development  
of their great ideas. Howard Gruber was a prominent creativity researcher,  
known especially for his Evolving Systems approach to creative thinking  
(see, e.g., Gruber 1980b; Gruber and Davies 1988). He delved into the lives  
of very creative individuals (including Charles Darwin and Jean Piaget)  
and described their breakthroughs as emanating from lifelong engagement  
with creative endeavors. Gruber ’ s work was based on detailed case stud-  
ies, in many of which archival materials were used. Gardner (1993) fol-  
lowed suit, inspecting several cases of creative individuals. His studies are  
less detailed than those in Gruber ’ s monumental work, but taken together  
they are highly instructive. In the design literature we do not have many

**114 Chapter 6**

comprehensive case studies, but some short accounts exist (e.g., Roy 1993).  
Biographies and autobiographies of designers do not differ in principle  
from monographs on other creative and accomplished individuals in these  
genres; see, for example, Leibowitz 1989, in which writings by the archi-  
tect Louis Sullivan are discussed. Case studies, biographies, and historical  
accounts are most suitable to the study of instances of H-creativity.  
In addition, there have been a number of attempts to reconstruct cre-  
ative processes by prominent personalities. For example, Hans K ö nig (1992)  
proposed a series of actions that according to him reconstruct the process of  
Juan Gris in the production of a famous still-life painting. Subrata Dasgupta  
(1994) presented a reconstruction of Maurice Wilkes ’ invention of micro-  
programming, which may be seen as an extremely creative case of design.  
Dasgupta ’ s analysis, though computational in essence, is a rare attempt to  
see the case through a cognitive lens.

**Measurements of creativity**  
The psychometric approach to creativity was pioneered by J. Paul Guilford,  
who suggested that creative achievement is commensurate with mental  
abilities that can be differentiated and measured, much as in studies of  
intelligence (see, e.g., Guilford 1956). Guilford talked mainly about pro-  
ductive thinking, as had the Gestalt psychologists several decades earlier.  
He claimed that creativity depends largely on divergent thinking, which  
included fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In addition, he  
claimed that transformations of thought, reinterpretations, and freedom  
from functional fixedness in deriving new solutions were essential to cre-  
ativity. Guilford ’ s Structure of the Intellect approach led to the develop-  
ment of creativity tests, of which there are many variants; the best-known  
ones were developed by E. Paul Torrance. Torrance ’ s Tests of Creative  
Thinking (1974), which are still in wide use today, score abilities related  
to what Torrance called “ skills that seem to be important in producing cre-  
ative responses ” (1988, 66). Criticisms of such tests question their predic-  
tive power and point out their apparent susceptibility to administration,  
scoring, and training effects (Plucker and Renzulli 1999).  
The only specific psychometric studies of designers of which I am aware  
are in MacKinnon ’ s 1962 study of architects ’ personalities, which used psy-  
chometric tools.  
The experimental approach is not radically different from the psychomet-  
ric approach. However, it usually tends to separate specific problem-solving

**Design Creativity 115**

cognitive capabilities and study them in isolation. An example may be the  
role of visual imagery, or the role of analogy, in creative thinking and prob-  
lem solving. This type of research is most appropriate for the study of the  
creative process.

**Neurocognitive exploration of creative thought**  
Neurocognitive studies of creativity center on memory activation in the  
brain, which displays different patterns in creative thinking than in “ ordi-  
nary ” thinking. The first notable trait of memory is that it is distributed  
(Kanerva 1988). This means that the storage of memory items is distributed  
across many memory locations (neurons) in a restricted region in the brain.  
The second important trait is that memory is content addressable (Gabora  
2010). This suggests that the content of a memory item corresponds to the  
location (neurons) in which it is stored and from which it can be retrieved.  
As a result, items with related meaning are stored in overlapping or close  
locations.  
Attention to a stimulus causes activation. The pattern of activation may  
be flat or spiky, depending on the type of attention paid to the stimulus  
and the kind of thinking it evokes. A flat pattern corresponds to a high  
level of activation that results from de-focused attention to a stimulus or  
stimuli. In this case, more overlapping memory locations are activated in  
the relevant region. De-focused attention is directed at the overall contem-  
plated image and many of its details. In contrast, focused attention, wherein  
attention is paid to certain details of a stimulus, results in a distribution  
of memory locations that are farther from one another, and therefore cre-  
ate a spiky pattern. The spiky pattern corresponds to analytic, convergent  
thought, whereas the flat pattern of activation is more related to associative,  
divergent thought. Creativity requires variable focus, i.e., shifts between  
the two modes of attention. This is one aspect of memory activation that is  
controllable, and the ability to spontaneously widen and shrink the scope of  
attention and therefore the activation function is indispensable in creative  
thinking (Gabora 2010; Martindale 1999). Since designing involves rigorous  
visual thinking and representation (internal and external) and intensive use  
of visual stimuli of all kinds, these finding are of particular relevance to the  
study of design thinking and design creativity, although the explorations  
reported in this book are obviously not conducted in the realm of neuro-  
cognitive research. We recognize that, among other differences, the time  
scale of neurological activity is completely different from that of cognitive

**116 Chapter 6**

operations, and therefore no direct application of neurological data to the  
type of research discussed here, which is largely behavioral, is suggested.  
This line of research is mentioned here because the findings so far appear  
to support outcomes obtained in behavioral cognitive research and because  
the two fields are moving toward one another. This appears to offer many  
new research opportunities for the study of design thinking and design  
creativity.

**Convergent and Divergent Thinking Revisited**

Creativity can be studied by conducting regular behavioral experiments of  
the kind used to explore cognitive activity, and the linkographic experi-  
ments are seen as belonging in this category, although in most cases no  
hypotheses are put forth to be confirmed or refuted.  
In chapter 3 it was suggested that linking moves forward and backward  
reflects shifts between divergent and convergent thinking. It was also stated  
that the creativity literature concerns itself primarily with divergent think-  
ing, and that psychometric tests are geared to measure divergent and not  
convergent thinking or shifts between the two. This is also true of design  
research as exemplified by the recent work of Toshiharu Taura and Yukari  
Nagai (2013). Taura and Nagai maintain that creative design is the function  
of designers ’ ability to expand their thought space (the equivalent of the  
more usual term “ design space ” ) during the preliminary concept-generation  
phase. Taura and Nagai recognize the importance of going back and forth  
in thought, but they still concentrate on divergent thinking and have little  
to say about convergent thinking.  
I take the position, supported by neurocognitive research, that creative  
thinking involves both divergent and convergent thinking. Support for this  
view is expressed by several cognition researchers. For example, David Per-  
kins (1981) proposed that critical responses in creative thought involve an  
intuitive process and an analytical process, which are roughly the same  
as divergent and convergent processes. Perkins went on to say that these  
processes are usually discussed separately, but that on his view “ the two  
strategies could occur mixed in behavior ” (ibid., 105). Elsewhere he stated  
explicitly that “ typical inventive thinking appears to demand a generous  
helping of both \[divergent and convergent thinking\], ” and that “ inventive  
people are mode shifters ” (1992, 249). In a later text, Jonathan Plucker and  
Joseph Renzulli wrote:

**Design Creativity 117**

Divergent thinking tests historically occupy nearly the entire creative process spot-  
light. Since the ability to generate ideas is only one aspect of the creative process  
(see, e.g., Runco and Okuda, 1988, in their discussion of the componential theory  
of creativity), its predominance devalues the integral role of creativity in the solving  
of problems.... Runco (1991) observes, “ The evaluative component of the creative  
process has received very little attention.... This is surprising because it is a vital  
constituent of the creative process, and is required whenever an individual selects  
or expresses a preference for an idea or set of ideas. (Runco 1991, 312; Plucker and  
Renzulli 1999, 41\)

Several methodologists have talked about divergent and convergent  
design phases in a prescriptive model of designing (see, e.g., Cross 1994;  
Fricke 1996; Pugh 1991; Roozenburg and Eekels 1995). In reaction to such  
talk, Ying-Chieh Liu, Thomas Blight and Amaresh Chakrabarti (2003) chal-  
lenged the notion that conceptual design consists of broad phases of diver-  
gence, and then similarly extensive periods of convergence. They proposed  
an alternative view, “ multiple divergence-convergence, ” that they claimed  
was more accurate. That approach, Liu et al. recommended, “ is to carry out  
divergent and convergent activities in each level of solution abstraction ”  
(ibid., 346). Regarding spoken language in design processes involving more  
than one person, Andy Dong wrote: “ Designers routinely draw from a wide  
body of knowledge and experiences, personal and otherwise to establish  
the meaning that is assembled into the designed work.... Our explana-  
tion is that their language is aggregating toward a coherent design concept  
through cycles of convergence and divergence. ” (2007, 11\) None of these  
studies reported empirical investigations at the cognitive level. Since the  
cognitive level is the main focus of this discourse, let us look at design cre-  
ativity in terms of forelinks and backlinks of critical moves.  
In chapter 3 above, it was proposed that forelinks represent divergent  
thinking and that backlinks stand for convergent thinking. In this chapter,  
special attention will be paid to forelinking critical moves. This is not to say  
that backlinking critical moves will be neglected or considered secondary.

**Linkographs and Creativity**

In his studies of the lives of very creative individuals, Howard Gruber did not  
conduct experiments, did not study short “ live ” episodes, and did not look  
at small-scale cognitive processes. But some of his insights into long-term  
creative endeavors also apply to short-term processes, just as smaller-scale

**118 Chapter 6**

neurological patterns are relevant to explorations at the cognitive scale.  
Gruber, who avoided overemphasizing single inspirational moments, pro-  
claimed that “ emphasis is withdrawn from the supposed single great stroke  
of insight and transposed to the many moments of insight that occur in  
the course of a creative effort ” (Gruber and Davies 1988, 244). Elsewhere,  
Gruber stated that “ interesting creative processes almost never result from  
single steps, but rather from concatenations and articulation of a complex  
set of interrelated moves ” (1980a, 177).  
If Gruber is right, we may conclude that the networks of links in linko-  
graphs may be useful in detecting creativity, in this case design creativity.  
Linkographs do not necessarily tell us everything there is to know about  
the creative process; referring back to the protocols may yield additional  
noteworthy information. For example, a protocol may reveal that a well-  
structured and highly interconnected linkograph describes a process involv-  
ing analogical reasoning or imagistic reasoning — something that cannot  
be inferred from the linkograph alone. It is reasonable to assume that, at  
the cognitive scale at which design thinking is being dealt with in this  
book, design processes differ from one another in the level of creativity  
they exhibit. Here linkography will be used to point out these differences.  
For an example, let us return to the Delft team protocol, document-  
ing a bicycle rack design. A breakthrough was clearly identifiable when  
the designer John made a move in which he responded to the need to do  
something about the backpack ’ s straps and suggested that the team see the  
bicycle rack it was designing for the backpack as a tray (unit 32, move 30):

*Move 30 (John)* So it ’ s either a bag, or maybe it ’ s like a little vacuum-formed  
tray kind of for it to sit in.

The tray idea was soon accepted by the other members of the team, who  
recognized that it addressed two aspects of the problem that were not  
resolved by seeing the rack as a flat plastic surface: how to contain the  
backpack ’ s straps and how to protect the backpack from mud. The team  
immediately developed the tray idea, recognizing that it addressed all their  
concerns (later the production method was changed from vacuum forming  
to injection molding). Figure 6.1 shows the linkograph of unit 32 of the  
team protocol, in which all of this occurred.  
Between moves 28 and 54 there is a heavily interlinked group of moves,  
including three webs (moves 30 – 37, moves 41 – 46, and moves 45 – 51\) and

**Design Creativity 119**

several critical moves, thirteen of which are at the threshold level of six  
links. Seven of these moves are CM^6 s \> , five are \< CM^6 s, and one is a \< CM^6 \>.  
Let us look at these critical moves — or this “ critical path, ” as John Habraken  
would call the sequence:

*Move 28 \> (Ivan)* We ’ ll just call it that for now, er bag, put it in a bag, we ’ re  
gonna need some sort of thing to do something with those straps

*Move 30 \> (John)* So it ’ s either a bag, or maybe it ’ s like a little vacuum-formed  
tray kind of for it to sit in

*Move 31 \> (Ivan)* Yeah a tray that ’ s right OK

*Move 32 \> (John)* ’ Cause it would be nice I think, I mean just from a position-  
ing standpoint, if we ’ ve got this frame outline and we know that they ’ re  
\[the clients are\] gonna stick with that, you can vacuum form a a tray or a

*Move \< 35 (John)* Maybe the tray could have plastic snap features in it, so  
you just like kkkkkk snap your backpack down in it

*Move \< 37 (John)* It ’ s a multifunction part huh

*Move 41 \> (Ivan)* Uh uh what if your bag were big er, what if you ’ re, you ’ re  
on er, if this tray were not plastic but like a big net you just sorta like pulled  
it around and zipped there I dunno

**Figure 6.1**  
Linkograph of unit 32, Delft team protocol.

**120 Chapter 6**

*Move \< 42 \> (John)* Maybe it could be part, maybe it could be a tray with a,  
with a net and a drawstring on the top of it, I like that

*Move 44 \> (Ivan)* A tray with sort of just hanging down net, you can pull it  
around and and zip it closed

*Move 45 \> (Kerry)* It could be like a a a window shade so you can kinda, it  
sinks back in, so it just

*Move \< 50 (John)* So what we ’ re doing right now, though is, we ’ re coming up  
with like again classifications of solutions of kind of all, they ’ re all “ either  
or ” things, I mean like we wouldn ’ t do the net and the shade and the snap  
in with the tray either or any one of those will probably

*Move \< 51 (Kerry)* A net can be combined with a shade, I mean you could  
have a retractable net that, that ’ s how I thought of it

*Move \< 54 (John)* I think tray is sorta a new one on the list, it ’ s not a subset  
of bag, it ’ s a kind of er yeah, but oh yeah yeah oh I see, shade straps is how  
do you dress the straps on the back

This is a very interesting group of moves, all generated in a little less than  
three minutes (between moves 28 and 54). In the first move the bag con-  
cept was seen by Ivan as a fait accompli that still required a solution to the  
problem of the straps. As soon as the tray concept was raised, just a few sec-  
onds later, it was contemplated in conjunction with concepts raised earlier  
(bag, net, shade), and attempts were made to combine all of these concepts.  
One could even interpret the verbalizations by Ivan and Kerry as a careful  
and subtle struggle to preserve ideas that they had already accepted and  
that they were not easily willing to discard in favor of the new idea. John,  
the initiator of the tray concept, insisted that the tray was a stand-alone  
idea that was not a subset of any of the previous concepts. All the same, as a  
veteran team player, he displayed openness to the possibility of a combina-  
tion of ideas — hence the double-speared move 42, in which John conceded  
that the solution could be a tray with a net and a drawstring.  
Several of the participants in the Delft protocol workshop pointed to this  
passage as a turning point in the design process, and this was evident in one  
way or another in the notations they used in their analyses of the protocol  
(Cross 1997). But linkography, Nigel Cross said, was “ the analysis that came  
closest to both tracing the history of the emergence of the tray concept and  
indicating its important role ” (ibid., 314).

**Design Creativity 121**

For present purposes, this provides an excellent example of the birth of  
a new and creative idea that was not completely detached from what had  
happened earlier in the process, including the flat plastic rack in earlier  
units of the protocol. While relating to previous deliberations, this idea also  
affected subsequent moves in the design process. The linkograph shows  
that moves 60 – 68 are heavily linked to moves 41 and 44, and to a lesser  
degree also to move 42\. Moves in posterior units also related to the tray  
concept, but this cannot be shown in the linkograph of unit 32\. This short  
episode emphasizes the network nature of design thinking in general and  
creative design thinking in particular. It also shows that inventive ideas,  
if they are to be successful, must be developed further and must be rigor-  
ously assessed against previous work, including design decisions already  
made and design criteria already agreed upon (e.g., containment of straps).  
Therefore, we get both CMs \> and \< CMs in this passage — that is, both diver-  
gent and convergent thinking take place, with frequent shifts between the  
two modes. The high percentage of CMs in this unit is also indicative of its  
highly productive nature: at the level of CM^6 , 27 percent of the moves are  
critical; of those, 58 percent are critical because of forelinks. At the level of  
CM^7 , 19 percent of the moves are critical and of those, 62 percent are criti-  
cal because of forelinks. It may also be worth noting that most of the CMs  
are strategically located at beginnings and endings of discernible structural  
components of unit 32 (see chapter 5).  
We can also scrutinize the threshold level of CM^5 and compare the  
values found in unit 32 with those of units 37 – 39 in this protocol (see  
table 5.3). The proportion of CM^5 s is 36 percent in unit 32, 24 percent  
in unit 37, 23 percent in unit 39, and 10 percent in unit 38\. Fifty-six  
percent of the CM^5 s in unit 32 are critical because of forelinks. We see  
that, despite the creative leap, the proportion of CMs \> at all criticality  
thresholds is not overwhelming, between 56 percent and 62 percent. This  
means that a considerable number of critical moves are devoted primarily  
to assessment and evaluation, thus concurring with the theory that calls  
for divergent and convergent thinking in creative feats. The proportions  
above demonstrate that we see an increase in critical moves in a passage  
recognized independently as creative in the sense that it includes a break-  
through. These critical moves are rather well balanced between forelinking  
and backlinking, that is, divergent and convergent thinking, with frequent  
shifts between them.

**122 Chapter 6**

As was discussed in chapter 5 and shown in tables 5.6 and 5.7, critical  
moves are in fact bidirectional. That is, although they are critical owing to  
their links either forward or backward, they also “ dedicate ” 20 percent or  
more of the total number of links they generate to the opposite direction.  
This reinforces Perkins ’ (1981) view that the two modes of thinking “ can  
occur mixed in behavior. ” Here we ought to refer once again to Gruber,  
who wrote: “ Insofar as divergent thinking plays some role in creative work,  
the system within which it occurs must regulate it, prevent it from running  
amok, require it to generate a well-chosen alternative. ” (1980b, 287 – 288\)  
The required actions to which Gruber pointed can be interpreted as con-  
vergent thinking embedded in backlinking critical moves and backlinks of  
critical moves with mostly forelinks.  
Let us return to a study, described in chapter 5, wherein Dan Tatsa  
looked at ideas generated by architecture students in a semester-long studio  
project (see Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005). After the end of the semester  
the students themselves assessed their projects ’ ideas in terms of criticality,  
which meant contribution to the final outcome. In addition to a connec-  
tion that was found between the level of self-assessed criticality of ideas  
and link indices derived from linkographs (as reported in chapter 5), the  
same study also looked at correlations between ideas and the final grades  
assigned to the students. This is of interest here because the criteria for  
awarding grades emphasize creativity. First Tatsa calculated the correlation  
between grade and the number of all ideas; this correlation was not sig-  
nificant. He then repeated the calculation for critical ideas only, and found  
a significant positive, even high, correlation between their number and  
the project ’ s grade ( *N* \= 8; *r* \= 0.699, *p* \< 0.5). This confirms that processes  
that included a higher number of critical ideas, as assessed by the students  
themselves, yielded outcomes that teachers deemed higher in quality and  
more creative. This finding is in line with results from the Delft protocols  
research described in this section, namely, that creative episodes display a  
high proportion of critical moves.

**Ideas and links**  
Let us now turn to another example, one derived from studies by Remko  
van der Lugt (2001, 2003\) that do not focus on critical moves but still count  
links. Van der Lugt (2001) studied differences among structured idea gen-  
eration meetings and the effect of sketching on the processes in these meet-  
ings. To do so he used linkography that facilitated quantitative analyses

**Design Creativity 123**

and comparisons of processes. Linkographs were constructed for design ses-  
sions that were conducted using different methods, so that the pattern of  
links among the ideas raised in them was revealed. A link in this case meant  
that an idea built on a previous idea generated in that meeting. In a final  
step, the participants were asked to appraise the ideas raised in the meeting  
in terms of their creative qualities. Later these appraisals were correlated  
with their “ linking scores ” (van der Lugt 2003). Each participant was given  
a number of colored stickers. The four red stickers were to be used to indi-  
cate the four most surprising ideas, then four green stickers to indicate the  
four most feasible ideas, and the one blue sticker to indicate the most excit-  
ing idea (the idea the participant “ would be most excited about developing  
further ” ). The 192 ideas that had been generated in four design meetings  
were then scored by the number of stickers applied to them according to  
the formula

Score \= green stickers \+ red stickers \+ 2(green and red stickers)

* 4(blue stickers).

Using the scores, van der Lugt divided the ideas into two groups: ideas with  
a score of 7 or more and ideas with a score of less than 7\. Then *t* \-tests were  
used to check the difference between the groups in terms of the number  
of links among ideas as notated in the linkographs. The difference proved  
significant ( *p* \< 0.05), with 3.08 links for the high-scoring ideas and 2.13 for  
the low-scoring ideas. A detailed analysis of the differences between ideas  
that received colored stickers in any of the categories and ideas that did not  
receive any stickers also showed that the former had higher rates of link-  
ing. Van der Lugt concluded that there was a strong connection between  
“ the perceived quality of an idea ” and the number of links it generated  
(ideas it built on, and ideas that built on it). For van der Lugt “ idea quality ”  
is unequivocally related to creativity and the criteria for awarding stick-  
ers reflect this stance. However, he proposed that further research should  
use quality assessments by independent judges, rather than self-appraisals.  
Even so, this study lends further support to the notion that intense inter-  
linking among design ideas is a prerequisite for creativity.

**Expert and novice designers**  
Let us now return to the MIT branch library design study, in which the  
participants included “ ordinary ” architects and studio teachers, one nov-  
ice student, and one prominent architect (Martin, who at the time of the

**124 Chapter 6**

experiment was internationally very famous). Martin handled the library  
design task easily, explaining the principles of his design theory in length  
and then producing a comprehensive solution within minutes. His design  
was by far the most complete and most creative of the designs obtained in  
this exercise.^2 This is not surprising — we know that experts, and certainly  
masters, “ immediately produce higher quality options ” (Bj ö rklund et al.  
2013, 139\) and “ seem to choose a preferred option rather early on ” (ibid.,  
140), with no need to consider many options. Figure 6.2 is a linkograph of  
the 22 moves in which Martin completed most of his design solution.  
When the linkograph in figure 6.2 is compared with those of the pro-  
cesses of Gilbert, Gideon, and Glenda, who worked on the same task (see fig-  
ures 5.6 – 5.8), it is immediately apparent that Martin ’ s linkograph is denser  
in links and contains a higher proportion of critical moves. Although direct  
comparison is not possible, because this linkograph is considerably shorter  
than the other three, it appears that Martin (whose process had two distinct  
portions) was able to interconnect his design acts in a dense mesh — even  
more so than Glenda, who stood out among the three linkographs por-  
trayed in chapter 5\.  
When he first saw the library ’ s footprint, Martin complained that it  
lacked organization. He proceeded to explain and sketch how spatial orga-  
nization might be achieved. After Martin stated that he was not able to

**Figure 6.2**  
Linkograph of episode from Martin ’ s design process, branch library design task.

**Design Creativity 125**

work without any context, the researcher drew a rectangle representing a  
site with the library in its midst, added some trees (scattered about the  
site), and indicated north. Martin postponed dealing with the articulation  
of spaces within the library until later in the process. Let us look at Martin ’ s  
critical moves at a threshold of four links:

*Move 2 \>* It ’ s important enough because there \[outdoor area shaded by trees,  
across from the library ’ s entrance\] one starts creating a space.

*Move 4 \>* I would make the entry — one can come through the cars \[parking\]  
here; it ’ s the case of the other side as well.

*Move \< 9 \>* We start creating a hierarchy.... The large trees, the parking lots,  
the pedestrians, an entry axis.

*Move 10 \>* I would then look for a direct relationship between entrance and  
exterior, because here, the real edge is not this \[edge of building\], for me it ’ s  
that \[boundaries of the lot\].

*Move 17 \>* So this is a way of letting elements of nature into the project. I  
don ’ t like isolated buildings.

*Move 18 \>* The building needs to reach from here to here \[boundaries of the  
lot\]. I would try through this organization to make space reach until there,  
so it has tension, it has a prolongation. It isn ’ t a small shed, it isn ’ t a pavil-  
ion on the interior. There. This is a different approach, but already, these  
elements there have found a different organization, and beyond functions,  
beyond, I would say, the interior organization.

*Move \< 20* So I will make the organization of the parking lots give force,  
with the trees, to this idea. I always want to take the entire, all of the land.

*Move \< 21* I think that if there are two roads, there is already something  
artificial... drawn by man. I find it justified to master the whole. Not let  
the pavilion swim in the middle. So you see how the discourse becomes  
immediately one of exterior.

In the moves listed above, Martin did the following, while sketching  
continuously: First, he noticed that the trees, which cast shadows, enclosed  
an outdoor area adjacent to the library wall. He established an entry point  
into the library ’ s footprint across from the wall facing the trees, and desig-  
nated parking lots on either side of the entrance. He then reflected on the  
relationship between the parking lots, the entry, and the outdoor space  
enclosed by the trees in the “ back ” of the building. He declared that a

**126 Chapter 6**

hierarchy had been established among these elements through a (visual)  
axis that ran from the entry to the trees in the back, through a glazed back  
wall. He went on to emphasize the relationship between inside and out-  
side spaces, adding that for him they were inseparable since the edges of  
the building were really outside, at the boundaries of the lot, and included  
outdoor spaces. For Martin, the hierarchy and the axis connecting the  
main elements of the building and its surroundings and governing the rela-  
tionships among them, were the way to achieve organization, which was  
important to him. An examination of Martin ’ s built works and their docu-  
mentation in professional publications shows that indeed motifs of hierar-  
chy and visual axes play a very important role in his approach to designing  
buildings. The emphasis on the relation of the indoor spaces with the exte-  
rior, which came up again and again in the protocol, is also a hallmark of  
Martin ’ s built work (see also chapter 3).  
In the linkograph of this short vignette we see that even at the threshold  
of five links there are three critical moves, or 14 percent of all moves. When  
we look at CM^4 s, we find eight critical moves, or 36 percent of all moves — a  
high percentage, especially in comparison with the 18 percent in Glenda ’ s  
protocol and the much lower percentages in the linkographs of Gilbert and  
Gideon. Such high rates are not typical of most episodes, with the pos-  
sible exception of short passages in which a significant breakthrough is  
achieved, as we have seen in the case of unit 32 of the Delft team protocol.  
In Martin ’ s process in this task we cannot claim a breakthrough; instead  
we know that a “ good fit ” among elements, which was quickly established,  
turned the ill-defined problem into an easily solvable one. Interestingly,  
the CM^4 s include five CMs \> , two \< CMs, and one \< CM \>. The two-headed  
critical move, quite a rare phenomenon, is move 9, in which the all-impor-  
tant principles of hierarchy and axis appear.  
We can compare Martin ’ s linkograph to those of Gilbert, Gideon, and  
Glenda in another criterion: that of the proportion of unidirectional and  
bidirectional moves. In Martin ’ s entire linkograph we find only one move  
that has no backlinks (move 4\) and only four moves that have no forelinks  
(moves 7, 14, 16, and 21). This amounts to 25 percent unidirectional  
moves, and therefore 75 percent bidirectional moves. The percentages of  
bidirectional moves for the three other library designers are 67 percent for  
Glenda, 53 percent for Gideon, and 67 percent for Gilbert.^3 Similar val-  
ues are encountered in other linkographs; for example, the proportion of

**Design Creativity 127**

bidirectional moves in the ashtray linkograph (figure 4.3), which is of simi-  
lar length, is 64 percent. Bidirectionality is related to fast shifts between  
divergent and convergent thinking, which is typical of creative processes.  
Therefore, this short episode exemplifies Martin ’ s almost simultaneous  
divergent-convergent thinking in a highly creative instance of designing.  
Much can be learned from a comparison between Martin ’ s high-end  
process and the very low-end process of Alice, another participant in the  
library design exercise. Figure 6.3 shows the linkograph of a portion of  
Alice ’ s process. Alice, a first-year graduate student of architecture, had no  
design background (her undergraduate degree was in chemistry), and in the  
exercise she groped to make sense of the library ’ s footprint and the con-  
sequences of entering it from each of the optional entry points. Her great  
discovery was that penetrating the building near the center is advantageous  
in terms of people ’ s circulation in the building. In the debriefing after the  
exercise, when asked about possible differences between her process and  
the presumed process of an experienced architect, she replied as follows:

I don ’ t know if he would look at this \[footprint\] and immediately see these \[impli-  
cations of entry options\] and wouldn ’ t even have to draw it for himself because he  
can see it. I felt I had to stop and go through all of them \[entry options\] and actually

**Figure 6.3**  
Linkograph of episode from Alice ’ s design process, branch library design task.

**128 Chapter 6**

draw out for myself what I ’ m saying in words. He might just say “ this, this and this.  
I know what I ’ d prefer, or what my client would prefer. ”... He could just look at it  
and immediately see a lot of things I couldn ’ t.

Alice got it right: Martin worked very rapidly, as if he could see the com-  
plete solution in his head before sketching it, much as Mozart was said to  
be able to hear a whole symphony in his “ mind ’ s ear. ”  
The linkographs of the processes of Martin and Alice are similar in  
length (22 and 27 moves, respectively), but that is about all they have in  
common. Alice generated a small number of links, and no move in this  
stretch has more than two links either backward or forward. Therefore,  
there are no critical moves at all. The proportion of bidirectional moves is  
40 percent, similar to Gilbert ’ s. We also do not discern a visible structure  
in this process, whereas Martin ’ s process is highly structured. Alice ’ s pro-  
cess was not creative in this episode — not necessarily because she is not a  
creative person, but perhaps because she lacked the skills needed to handle  
the task and her approach was that of a layperson. Her thinking pattern  
was not a divergent-convergent one, and she was content with just under-  
standing how entering at one or another point affects movement in the  
library. To accentuate the difference between the processes of Alice and  
Martin, sketches by both of them, exploring the implications of entering  
the library at entry point 1, are presented in figure 6.4 (for all the optional  
entry points, see the appendix).  
Only a very experienced and creative designer with a solid design theory,  
and a well-developed kit of tools that allow him or her to mold any design  
situation so as to be manageable with those tools and according to that  
theory, can operate the way Martin did here. This entails moving back and  
forth, thinking divergently and convergently with very frequent shifts in a  
structured process, while generating moves that are highly interlinked, for  
the most part in both directions. Alice, a novice with very little domain-  
specific knowledge, could not possibly match such a performance.  
Needless to say, there is more to design creativity than links among  
moves. Other important features of creative thinking — for example, priori-  
tizing ideas, identifying opportunities, being able to use imagery or think  
analogically, and discerning useful information in stimuli — have not been  
discussed in this chapter. We have focused on the ability to connect and  
synthesize information, something that expert designers do well. According  
to Tua Bj ö rklund (2013, 152), product-development experts “ accommodate

**Design Creativity 129**

for a higher degree of interconnections both within the mental representa-  
tions and between the problem representations and outside knowledge. ”  
Bj ö rklund has shown empirically that Alexander ’ s (1964) “ good fit ” con-  
cept, according to which a successful design synthesis depends on a good  
fit between the solutions to subproblems into which a complex problem  
must be broken, is as valid as ever. The aim of this chapter, and that of the  
introductory comments in chapter 3, was to show that connectivity, or  
good fit, or a particularly successful synthesis, is a product of rapid shifting  
between small divergent and convergent thinking acts. The emphasis is on  
*small* : not only does creative design encompass divergent and convergent  
thinking; these modes of reasoning are so intertwined that it is hard to  
separate them.  
Linkography proves to be capable of disentangling instances of thinking  
as reflected in protocols, and of showing the close relationship between

**Figure 6.4**  
Explorative sketches of implications of entry 1, marked by arrows at the top. (a) Mar-  
tin ’ s. (b) Alice ’ s. In these sketches the library ’ s footprint is turned 90 º relative to the  
original drawing (see appendix).

**130 Chapter 6**

these two modes of thinking and reasoning. Thus, it is not enough to ask  
designers to generate more ideas, or even to generate innovative ideas. A  
designer has to acquire the mode of thinking whereby frequent proposi-  
tions are immediately followed by evaluative steps that make sure that the  
design holds together at every moment. It is not enough to have ideas,  
even many ideas; the ideas have to be good, and to be good they must be  
perfectly integrated and interlinked.

## 7 Further Insights

In this chapter, insights from thirteen studies in which linkography was  
used (for a variety of purposes) are reported. In some of them, linkographs  
of the original kind were used; in others, the linkographs were modified  
somewhat to suit the needs of specific research goals, and in one study,  
linkography was evoked as a metaphor. The reports are not meant to be  
critical; rather, they are meant to be impartial and faithful to the works they  
represent. The intent is to offer a glimpse at wide applicability options for  
linkography, beyond what has been dealt with in the previous chapters. In  
a few instances, I add a minor comment expressing my own view.

**Design Problem-and-Solution Spaces**

Kees Dorst (2003) was interested in the structure of design problems, which,  
he claimed, had not been studied sufficiently. Alongside the design process  
and the designer, the design problem is of great importance in the develop-  
ment of design strategies and methodologies. As was noted in chapter 2,  
design problems are considered to be ill-structured and even wicked. Dorst  
described the two major approaches to dealing with such problems, as  
exemplified in the writings of Herbert Simon and Donald Sch ö n.  
Simon (1973), who had developed a theory of problem solving for well-  
structured problems, recognized the difference between well-structuredness  
and ill-structuredness of problems. The differences notwithstanding, he  
thought that in principle both kinds of problems are subject to rational  
problem solving. Such problem solving takes place within a designated  
problem space (in which problem-related knowledge is represented) and  
a solution space (in which solution-related knowledge is represented).  
In this view, the problem space of an ill-structured problem is too large;

**132 Chapter 7**

consequently, the problem solver works within only part of the problem  
space, and the ensuing solution is therefore *satisficing* (sufficiently satisfy-  
ing; good enough) — it need not be optimal. This approach is called *technical*  
*rationality*.  
For Sch ö n (1983), technical rationality is the wrong paradigm for the  
treatment of ill-structured problems, which are frequently encountered in  
practice, including design practice. Departing from a constructivist point of  
view, Sch ö n advocated *reflective practice* , which is seen not as a way to solve  
problems but as a way to frame and reframe problematic, even “ messy ”  
situations, until they become malleable. In the case of design, this happens  
in a design space (rather than problem space). Sch ö n ’ s approach resembles  
the Gestalt approach to solving novel problems in that it requires produc-  
tive (as opposed to reproductive) thinking. The reflective practitioner uses  
experience and a repertoire of previously mastered solutions to see a messy  
situation in a new light wherein professional intervention is both possible  
and fruitful.  
Dorst maintained that neither Simon nor Sch ö n paid sufficient attention  
to the structure of a problem (or a situation). He believed that problems dif-  
fer, some likely to fall into the rational paradigm and others into the reflec-  
tive paradigm, and that the two approaches can be combined. Combining  
them, he thought, would lead to a definition of design tasks as situated  
problems, the structure of which Dorst wished to study by “ describ\[ing\] the  
behavior of designers as operations on the design problem. ” Dorst hoped  
to achieve this by using linkography. He opted for the matrix version, and  
proposed to use three different linkographs to record three different types  
of links between problem elements and solution elements that would be  
extracted from protocols, as follows:

Linkograph I would link among problem elements, ignoring solutions.

Linkograph II would link among solution elements, ignoring problems.

Linkograph III would link among problem and solution elements.

From these three linkographs Dorst expected to learn about different struc-  
tures of design problems, as related to the paradigms of technical rational-  
ity and reflective practice. He predicted that in rational problem solving,  
the design activity would focus first on the problem(s) and not on solu-  
tions, and that because to this focus there should be many links among  
problem elements (linkograph I). The solution would be tackled only later

**Further Insights 133**

in the process (linkograph II). He also estimated that the reflective practice  
paradigm should yield many links among problems and solutions, starting  
early in the process (linkograph III). Dorst proposed that the complete pat-  
tern of problem-solution connections that would be imposed on the prob-  
lem and the solution would be a *frame* and the actual linking of problem  
and solution would accordingly be the activity of framing.

**Conceptual Dependency Links and Chunks**

Masaki Suwa and Barbara Tversky (1997) were interested in architects ’ inter-  
pretations of their own sketches. They conducted a two-phase experiment  
with two experienced architects and seven advanced architecture students  
as subjects. In the first phase, each designer was asked to design a museum  
and its surroundings in a 45-minute session, which was videotaped. In  
the second phase, each participant was asked to articulate, while viewing  
the corresponding videotape, the thoughts he or she recalled having at the  
time each sketch was made. The verbalizations were recorded and tran-  
scribed into protocols, so this method falls into the category of retrospec-  
tive protocol analysis. The protocols were parsed into segments (resembling  
design moves), which then were encoded by means of a category scheme  
that included four major categories, each further divided into subcatego-  
ries. On the basis of the encoded protocols, Suwa and Tversky were able  
to point at a number of differences in the ways experienced architects and  
students used their sketching activities to develop design solutions.  
Later, Suwa and Tversky looked at links among protocol segments. Rather  
than produce linkographs per se, they established what they called “ con-  
ceptual dependencies ” among segments, on two levels. What they char-  
acterized as a conceptual dependency between a segment and a previous  
segment was identical to what I call a backlink. They soon discovered that  
“ the entire design process includes many blocks of contiguous segments ”  
(1997, 392). These blocks were called “ dependency chunks, ” a chunk being  
a small unit typically consisting of two or three segments. What Suwa and  
Tversky mean by “ chunk ” is very different from what I mean by the same  
term (see chapter 4). Links among adjacent segments within a chunk are  
reminiscent of a sawtooth track pattern. Suwa and Tversky interpreted such  
links as representing in-depth, detailed explorations of a design topic akin  
to what Vinod Goel (1995) called “ vertical transformations. ” The same

**134 Chapter 7**

segments may, however, also display links to more remote previous seg-  
ments, which are not included in the same chunk. Goel called such links  
“ lateral transformations. ” There are also stand-alone segments that do not  
belong to chunks.  
Figure 7.1 is a schematic representation of dependency chunks compris-  
ing twelve segments and dependency links among them in a small por-  
tion of Suwa and Tversky ’ s analysis. The first segment of a new chunk  
(or a stand-alone segment) was taken to represent a shift in focus. Suwa  
and Tversky found that the architects in their study had “ remarkably  
more continuing segments ” (within chunks) than the students. This led  
them to conclude that the architects had shifted focus less often. Accord-  
ing to Suwa and Tversky (1997, 395), the difference stemmed from the  
architects ’ ability to “ ‘ read off ” more different types of information from  
their sketches. ” Suwa and Tversky concluded their paper by recommending  
that a design-support tool that is intended to replace paper sketches should  
be able to evoke new ways of “ reading off ” information from sketch-like  
depictions.

**Topic Shifts in Design**

David Botta and Robert Woodbury (2013) were interested in design his-  
tories and especially in topic shifts. They developed a model that used an  
algorithm and linkographs to predict the locations of topic shifts. Their

**Figure 7.1**  
Conceptual dependencies. Source: Suwa and Tversky 1997, 394\. Reprinted with per-  
mission.

**Further Insights 135**

findings indicated that the rate of success of the predictions was reasonably  
high in large series, or data sets, but poor in small series, when compared  
to an independent human assessment of topic shifts in the same data sets.  
Botta and Woodbury posited two hypotheses: that “ a linkograph that is  
constructed from finer-grained design moves than topical segmentation  
can be used to predict topical segmentation ” and that “ the topical seg-  
mentation can provide a dynamic granularity by which to filter transitive  
links ” (ibid.).  
Botta and Woodbury ’ s data consisted of protocols of eleven instructional  
design meetings, each two to three hours long, in which a team worked to  
develop a broad first-year university course in design thinking. The first two  
meetings were exploratory, and Botta and Woodbury used them for a pilot  
study; the data obtained from these meetings were the notes of an observer.  
The subsequent nine meetings were audiotaped and then transcribed into  
protocols, which were segmented into units of one sentence each. A linko-  
graph was generated for each meeting. No initial breakdown of the meet-  
ing into separate units according to subject matter of the conversation was  
attempted (quite on the contrary, performing this breakdown mechanically  
was one of the goals of the study). Figure 7.2 shows an example of the  
linkographs produced in this study.  
After all links had been notated, Botta and Woodbury felt that only  
links between segments that were remote in time (which they called “ deep  
links ” ) should be considered; therefore they developed rules for filtering  
out links they considered to be transitive. If segment *n* linked back to seg-  
ment *n* – *3* and to segment *n* – *6* , the link to *n* – *3* was filtered out because  
it was considered insufficiently deep. Botta and Woodbury called this “ the  
*skip three segments* rule. ” A mathematical model (an algorithm) that was  
based on the first two exploratory meetings looked at the contribution of  
links to a measure of a topic shift. Contributions varied between 0 and 1 per  
link and were calculated separately for the sum of forelinks and the sum of  
backlinks. The algorithm was calibrated by trial and error to suit the more  
detailed data of the subsequent nine meetings.  
The model succeeded in predicting topic shifts in long series, with a  
success rate greater than 0.6. Any discrepancies between the predictions  
by the model and human assessment were attributed mainly to the fact  
that a human tends to choose the first sentence in a group of interlinked  
sentences as the initiation of a topic while the model relies on a linking

**136 Chapter 7**

measure that is sometimes higher for subsequent nearby sentences in the  
discussion, which expose the meaning of the topic more forcefully. When  
the method of interpreting the topic-shift measure was somewhat relaxed,  
a higher prediction rate (0.8) was achieved. The relaxation allowed the link-  
contribution measures of a few subsequent sentences to be added to the  
lead sentence, in case the measure of the initial sentence was significant but  
below a predetermined threshold. The number of added measures could  
be varied. Other relaxations included repetitions and redundant mate-  
rial: paragraphs that covered a lot of material, and frequent reminders of  
recent issues of the “ just said ” and “ incessant ” kind, were omitted from  
the count. The purpose was to achieve “ thick descriptions. ” The results  
roughly matched the predictions of topic shifts made using the “ skip three  
segments ” rule. Other cases of relaxation included segments with mainly  
transitive links in a text that was considered a “ calling text, ” defined as

having at least one deep (i.e., not transitive) link. These and other relax-  
ations made for a sufficiently dynamic model that could adapt itself to local  
circumstances of various portions of a design process.  
Botta and Woodbury concluded that the results they obtained, although  
encouraging, were rather weak in predictive power, especially for short  
series. However, they expressed hope that further development would be  
able to increase the rate of success, especially if an automated system for the  
construction of linkographs could be devised. Botta and Woodbury asserted  
that knowing the locations of topical shifts in a design history helps to  
bridge the gap between conversation and visual representations.

**Extended Linkographs**

Hui Cai, Ellen Yi-Luen Do, and Craig Zimring (2010) explored the effect of  
inspiration sources on the design process, which may be positive if they  
enhance idea generation or negative if they cause fixation. For their empiri-  
cal study, Cai et al. developed an extended version of the linkograph. Their  
desire to treat relatively long protocols ruled out the use of moves as units  
of analysis, as there would have been too many of them. Participating  
designers were asked to sketch in response to given visual stimuli, and their  
sketches were taken to reflect the influence of the sources of inspiration  
(the stimuli). Accordingly, the sketches were chosen as units of analysis.  
Each sketch was examined for its links with previous sketches and with the  
original stimulus.  
The links among sketches were seen as transformations. In line with the  
terminology of Goel (1995), they were classified as lateral transformations  
(LTs) or vertical transformations (VTs). A lateral transformation is a slightly  
different or alternative idea; a vertical transformation is an elaboration or  
detailing of a previous idea.^1 This distinction is notated in an extended  
linkograph, as shown in figure 7.3. The links can be counted separately, L LT  
representing lateral transformations and L VT representing vertical ones. Cai  
et al. asserted that the division into two types of transformation is relevant  
to the impact a stimulus has, and is also indicative of creativity: Along with  
a larger number of webs and chunks, vertical transformation represent a  
bolder detachment from the stimulus. A separate link-density index (the  
equivalent of link index) can also be calculated for the two types of links.  
Figure 7.3 illustrates the process of a participant who produced four sketches

**138 Chapter 7**

for two alternative solutions (solutions T-N1 and T-N2). T-N1 consisted of  
only one sketch, whereas T-N2 included three sketches. The links among  
these sketches are notated in a regular linkograph and in an extended link-  
ograph that breaks the linkograph into two perpendicular sublinkographs.

**Refining the Function-Behavior-Structure Ontology**

A coding system for design protocols called the FBS (Function, Behavior,  
Structure) ontology, advanced by John Gero and associates, was mentioned  
in chapter 2\. Introduced in a 1990 paper by Gero, it has undergone devel-  
opment ever since then. This ontology is designed to overcome difficulties  
stemming from the use of custom coding schemes. The use of such schemes  
“ limits the applicability of the results obtained ” (Kan and Gero 2009a, 228\)

because they are too particular to the case in hand. Function, behavior, and  
structure (and their subcategories) are independent of design domains and  
cases, as well as of the number of designers, and are claimed by Gero and  
associates to be a generally applicable coding basis.  
In order to refine the system, Gero and his associates (Kan 2008; Kan  
and Gero 2009a; Pourmohamedi and Gero 2011\) applied linkography to  
the FBS coding system. They started with a basic coding scheme comprising  
the following main categories and subcategories: Function (F), Structure (S),  
Expected behavior (Be), Behavior derived from structure (Bs), and Docu-  
ments (design description) (D). The relationship between elements thus  
coded represents the following design activities: formulation (inferring  
expected behaviors from functions and requirements), analysis, synthesis,  
evaluation, documentation, and three levels of reformulation (changing  
the space of possible designs by changing the structures, behaviors and  
functions). Two additional categories are requirements (R) and others (O).  
The latter may be taken out of the analysis later on. The protocol Kan and  
Gero (2009a) analyzed was of a session of an engineering project in which  
a two-person team worked on a new thermal printing pen. The session  
was selected because of the many analogies the designers evoked, which  
interested the researchers. The protocol was divided into segments that are  
precisely equivalent to moves. After they were coded, a linkograph was con-  
structed in order to determine links among segments of different codes.  
Figure 7.4 shows a portion of the linkograph.  
By comparing the percentage of segments of each code with the percent-  
age of links generated by segments of the same code, the researchers were  
able to compare the frequencies of the codes with the linking evidence and  
found that linking rates were above the frequency levels for segments coded  
S and Be; other codes displayed a slight drop in linkage rates compared to  
their frequencies (except R, which remained unchanged). The conclusion  
was that S and Be segments were more influential. Next the researchers  
determined which codes linked to same and other codes. After consolidat-  
ing codes into groups representing design activities, they were able to look  
at frequencies of transformations. They found that the most prominent type  
of transformation was from S to S (notated S \> S), which was translated into  
level 1 reformulation. Next in prominence were analysis (S \> Bs), evaluation  
(Be \< \> Bs), and synthesis (Be \> S), in a descending order of occurrence and per-  
centage. Kan and Gero (2009a) went on to refine their analysis by making

**140 Chapter 7**

some further distinctions within a “ situated FBS framework ” in which they  
introduced interactions among external, interpreted, and expected “ worlds  
of design. ” They repeated the previous analytic procedures to determine  
frequencies of transformations, based on links. Kan and Gero concluded  
that “ the links not only provide a structural view of the processes but also  
locate the dominant codes and the frequency of each design transforma-  
tion process ” (ibid., 228). The combination of linkography and the FBS  
ontology gives a sharper view of the network of acts in designing.  
To facilitate the analysis of FBS-based linkographs, Pourmohamedi and  
Gero (2011) developed a software system called lincoder.^2 Once a protocol  
is parsed using the FBS codes, the program automatically draws the cor-  
responding linkograph and analyzes it in accordance with a number of

the FBS scheme. Source: Kan and Gero 2009a, 218\. Reprinted with permission.

built-in quantitative parameters. In addition to the calculations performed  
by Kan and Gero (2009a) regarding distributions and frequencies of codes,  
these parameters include first-order and second-order Markov models and  
entropy calculations. The system is also capable of “ fractioning, ” “ window-  
ing, ” and “ trimming ” linkographs; all these operations are aimed at isolat-  
ing a portion of a linkograph in order to analyze it and perhaps compare  
it with other portions of the same or another linkograph. Pourmohamedi  
and Gero say they hope to further develop this program with open coding  
possibilities instead of the current restriction to the FBS ontology. They are  
also ready to rise to the formidable challenge of automating the coding and  
linking stages of protocol analysis and linkograph construction, which they  
rightly claim requires a lot of labor when done manually.

**Problem Framing in Different Design Settings**

Thomas Kvan and Song Gao (2006) set out to explore the important activ-  
ity of problem framing by design teams in digital and paper-based settings.  
Problem framing was adopted from Sch ö n (1983, 165\) as the initial phase  
in ill-defined problem solving wherein problem solvers “ determine the fea-  
tures to which they will attend, the order they will attempt to impose on the  
situation, the directions in which they will try to change it. In this process,  
they identify both the ends to be sought and the means to be employed. ”  
In this study an experiment was carried out in which participants solved  
a simple design problem in three different settings: online remote (chat-  
line-based textual communication and digital drawings), online co-located,  
and paper-based co-located. Six teams of two student designers each were  
assigned to each of the settings. The sessions were recorded and protocol  
analysis was employed. The protocols were parsed into moves, which then  
were coded using a scheme (adopted from Sch ö n 1983\) that had three cat-  
egories: framing, moving, and reflecting.  
The count of the categorized moves showed a significant difference  
between the online remote setting, which had a low number of activities,  
and the two co-located settings, which yielded a much higher number of  
overall activities. The frequency of each activity category in the three set-  
tings was inspected, and it was found that the online remote setting had  
the highest percentage of framing (almost 45 percent), and the lowest per-  
centage of moving (less than 25 percent). No significant differences were

**142 Chapter 7**

found between the other two settings, and the proportion of reflecting was  
similar in all settings (about 33 percent).  
Next, linkographs were constructed for each of the teams, and were  
divided into components. A component was defined as “ one unit in which  
all design units are inter-linked ” (Kvan and Gao 2006, 251), which is remi-  
niscent of the term “ chunk ” as introduced in this book. The average num-  
ber of components was highest in the paper-based setting and lowest in the  
online remote setting. The latter setting had the highest average link index,  
somewhat higher than the average for the other two settings. Kvan and  
Gao then singled out the largest components in each setting and compared  
them on diameter ( “ the number of linked design moves ” ; in our terms —  
link span) and depth ( “ the largest number of nodes linking two discrete  
design actions in a component ” ). The online remote setting had the great-  
est depth and the smallest diameter; the online co-located setting had the  
lowest depth and the largest diameter.  
The rest of the study focused on the largest component of each setting,  
for which two ratios were calculated: R1 (the ratio between the number of  
activities in the largest component divided by the number of activities in  
the entire protocol) and R2 (the ratio between the greatest depth in the larg-  
est component divided by the number of activities in the entire protocol).  
The highest R1 and R2 values were found in the remote online settings.  
Figure 7.5 shows the linkograph of one of those remote online protocols.  
The linkographs of the components with the highest R1 values in the  
other settings were much shorter. The percentage of framing activities in  
them was considerably lower; the R2 values were also much lower. For both  
ratios the components in question were poorly or not at all interlinked with  
adjacent components that preceded and followed the component under  
investigation.  
Kvan (2013) concluded that the findings suggest that digital tools are  
not detrimental to problem solving in conceptual design, that they do not  
interfere with framing, and that in fact they may support framing. This  
conclusion was surprising and counterintuitive, especially since it stands  
in contrast to designers ’ subjective reports and to findings in some other  
research projects. It was acknowledged that the sample was too small to  
allow general conclusions to be drawn, and that the quality of the resultant  
designs played no role in this study. Kvan (ibid.) explained that the insights  
gained from the study suggested that multiple representations in different

modes (including textual communication) are always advantageous. He  
believes that diagramming (sketching) is essential in designing; digital  
tools, especially in a remote collaboration, enable higher levels of abstrac-  
tion, which in turn enhances interpretative activity, which leads to framing  
and reframing. This may explain the results obtained in this experiment.

**Entropy and Productivity**

In a number of papers (Gero 2011; Kan 2008; Kan and Gero 2005, 2008,  
2009b; Kan, Bilda, and Gero 2007), John Gero and associates explored the  
use of entropy measurements based on linkographs to assess the produc-  
tivity of design processes. According to the notion of entropy they used,  
which was taken from information theory (Shannon 1948), “ the amount of  
information carried by a message or symbol is based on the probability of  
its outcome ” (Kan and Gero 2005, 52). Entropy is the amount of informa-  
tion that is missing before reception, or before communication is achieved.  
Kan and Gero applied this notion to the design process and claimed that  
a link between moves is information — the link is considered ON. Where  
there is no link between two moves, the link is considered OFF. If all moves

**144 Chapter 7**

are linked to all other moves in a linkograph, that is, if they are all ON, the  
linkograph is saturated. Shannon ’ s theory looks at the relationship between  
ON and OFF nodes in a selected set of symbols to calculate the set ’ s entropy.  
Maximum entropy ( *H* ) is achieved when that relationship is unpredict-  
able, because this situation is diversified and allows for surprise and further  
development. The maximum value, which is *H* \= 1, occurs when half the  
nodes are ON and the other half are OFF. In a linkograph of *n* moves, the  
potential number of links is *n* ( *n* – 1)/2 and therefore the highest entropy  
is achieved when the number of links is *n* ( *n* – 1)/4. When the linkograph  
is either empty or fully saturated, the entropy is at its lowest level, *H* \= 0\.  
The linkograph sets chosen by Gero and his associates for entropy calcu-  
lations are diagonal rows of backlinks that measure enhancement and con-  
firmation, diagonal rows of forelinks, measuring the new idea-generation  
opportunities, and the “ horizonlinks, ” the links along horizontal rows that  
measure cohesiveness and incubation. Figure 7.6 shows these rows. Entropy  
is calculated for each row separately according to a probability algorithm  
devised by Shannon. A mean value can then be calculated for each of the  
three types of rows.  
According to Jeff Kan, John Gero, and their associates, entropy is a yard-  
stick for measuring productivity. High entropy is indicative of a productive  
process; the researchers maintained that when the proportion of ON links  
is between 0.35 and 0.65, then *H* \> 0.93. In other words, if the rate of link-  
ing is between one-third and two-thirds of all possible links, the process is  
productive and we should expect a good outcome.  
Kan and Gero (2005) and Kan (2008) provided the preliminary theo-  
retical basis for design entropy measurements. In work that was reported  
in further publications, the researchers tested actual cases. Kan et al.  
(2007) looked at one of the findings of Bilda et al. (2006): that blindfolded

architects who had successfully completed a 45-minute design session  
using imagery only showed a decrease in cognitive activities after about 20  
minutes. Kan et al. (2007) asked whether this drop corresponded to a drop  
in entropy. They constructed linkographs of twelve design sessions under-  
taken by six participants in the experiment. Each participant completed  
two sessions: one in which sketching was allowed and one in which the  
designer was blindfolded. Entropies were calculated for the first 20 minutes,  
and for the remaining time (approximately 25 minutes) of each session.  
Values were normalized by dividing the sum of entropies of each segment  
by the number of segments; this was done for the three types of entropy  
described above. Entropy was found to have decreased in the second half  
of the session in all but one of the sketching sessions. In the blindfolded  
condition, results were mixed: half the participants showed similar trends  
in both session types; in the other half entropy values increased in the  
second half. This meant that the decrease in cognitive activities did not  
necessarily lead to a decrease in the generation of new ideas in the blind-  
folded sessions. When dynamic entropy charts were plotted to represent  
the entire linkographs, an interesting finding emerged. The plots were over-  
laid with quadratic (second-degree) polynomial fit curves. These may take  
one of three shapes: linear, ∪ , and ∩. According to Kan et al. (2007, 373),  
“ the ∪ shape trend suggests that the entropy values are climbing toward the  
end of the session indicating a well-integrated process, whereas the ∩ shape  
trend suggests the opposite. ” In these plots the trend remained the same  
for each participant across conditions, which may be related to individu-  
als ’ cognitive styles. Another observation was that the three sessions that  
scored the highest qualitatively all had ∪ \-shaped curves, whereas the three  
sessions that scored the lowest all had ∩ \-shaped curves. This may suggest  
that high entropy toward the end is, by and large, a sign of a productive  
session.  
In Kan and Gero 2009a, the authors extended the argument that  
linkographic entropy indicates productivity to claim that it is also a hallmark  
of creativity. They conducted an experiment in which they compared the  
processes of two teams, each consisting of two architects, that were charged  
with producing a conceptual design for an art gallery on a given site with a  
given brief. A qualitative assessment ranked one of the sessions as more cre-  
ative; the other session was considered pragmatic. First Kan and Gero cal-  
culated text entropies based on the protocols. Although the more creative

**146 Chapter 7**

session boasted almost twice as many words as the pragmatic session, the  
relative entropy and the text entropy were identical or almost identical  
in both cases. In the next stage Kan and Gero used WordNet to construct  
linkographs of the two sessions. The linkographs were based on at least four  
common “ synset IDs. ” A synset is a cognitive synonym that can be used to  
group words into sets of similar meaning. Words with the same synset share  
the same ID. Linkographs constructed with this automated method showed  
semantic links among verbalizations (nouns only) in the protocols. Since  
the numbers of segments in these linkographs differed, they were divided  
into 5-minute “ windows ” ; the mean entropy of these windows was then  
calculated. In this calculation a difference of about 15 percent was found in  
favor of the creative session. Kan and Gero also showed that the windows  
with the highest entropy were the most productive in terms of number of  
ideas generated and number of sketches produced.  
In yet another study, Gero (2011) used design entropy inferred from  
linkographs to measure design fixation. The premise was that entropy  
should be lower during fixation than during the rest of the process. In an  
empirical study in which fixation could be qualitatively detected, a proto-  
col was parsed and coded according to the FBS coding scheme (introduced  
earlier in this chapter); then a 116-segment linkograph was constructed.  
Entropy was calculated for portions of the linkograph, including twelve  
segments that appeared to display moments of fixation; this entropy was  
termed “ dynamic entropy. ” The exercise was repeated three times for three  
different local fixation instances. In each of these cases the entropy value  
at the point of fixation was the lowest in the sequence of entropy values  
measured for the series of twelve segments. Figure 7.7 shows a portion of  
the linkograph and one graph of dynamic entropy.  
In several publications (e.g., Kan and Gero 2008), Kan and Gero also  
suggested looking at links in a linkograph as nodes in a plane defined by *x*  
and *y* axes. Each link can then have an *x* value (its distance from move 1\)  
and a *y* value that corresponds to its link span. The *x* and *y* values can be  
calculated for each move, and a mean value called the *centroid* can be estab-  
lished. “ A higher mean value of *x* , ” Kan and Gero wrote, “ implies that more  
nodes appear at the end of a session and a lower value suggests that more  
nodes are present in the beginning of the session.... A higher mean value  
of *y* indicates longer linking lengths \[spans\]. ” (ibid., 324\) This gives a very  
rough indication of distribution of links; however, as Kan and Gero noted,

it does not reveal anything regarding the spreading of the links. Therefore,  
they also calculate the standard deviations, “ which suggest how concen-  
trated the nodes are clustered around the means ” (ibid., 324).

**Linkography and Space Syntax**

Tamer El-Khouly and Alan Penn (2012) sought to relate linkographs and  
graphs of urban systems used in Space Syntax studies. Such systems are  
very complex, and the authors investigated and measured properties of  
linkographs in order to shed light on certain characteristics that are also  
found in urban systems, such as access to locations via road networks. Two  
perspectives (seen here as discrete theories) illuminated the study: that of  
information theory and that of entropy theory. The main hypothesis of  
the paper was that “ in multi-level complex systems high orderliness tends  
to become less complex overall, and therefore a highly linked node deliv-  
ers few choices and probabilities ” (ibid., 3). A further hypothesis was that  
“ complexity is created in different scales in the graph system from the local  
subgraph to the whole system ” (ibid., 1). In this graph system a node cor-  
responds to a move in the terminology of this book.  
The backward and forward links and “ no-links ” (that is, empty spots on  
a link line, where there are no links to other moves) of each node (move) are  
listed in a separate subgraph. This is noted in a combination of a backlinks  
string and a forelinks string, where a link is notated as 1 and its absence is  
notated as 0\. The forelinks string follows the backlinks string, separated by  
a dot. The string is considered to be a “ string of information ” that repre-  
sents the complexity of the particular subsystem. Figure 7.8 shows a linko-  
graph and the compilation of the strings of information for node 15\.  
As in Kan and Gero 2008, the premise in El-Khouly and Penn 2012 was  
that to achieve complexity high entropy is needed, which means a combi-  
nation of ones and zeroes in strings. An “ empty ” string of zeroes only (no  
links) and a “ saturated ” string of ones only (each node is linked to every  
other node) have an equally low entropy — in fact, the entropy is zero —  
meaning a low probability for complexity.  
Later in the paper, El-Khouly and Penn compared three types of mea-  
sures extracted from linkographs — integration, complexity, and entropy —  
for two sets of linkographs: ordered and structured linkographs. The  
former are saturated, the latter are not. Then they looked at the degree of

**Further Insights 149**

correlation of entropy, complexity, and integration. Complexity and entropy  
are “ dynamic ” ; that is, they vary along the system, as each node has a  
different value. Many of the correlations between integration and com-  
plexity and between integration and entropy were found to be negative,  
and when positive they were mostly low. Correlations between complex-  
ity and entropy were positive but low. The linkographs in question were  
short, comprising 21 nodes, and the authors found that measures for short  
sequences were inadequate. Therefore they set out to look at correlations in  
two much longer linkographs that consist of hundreds of nodes. First, using  
syntactical methods, they identified the most integrated nodes and looked  
at similar correlations as in the short linkographs, supplemented by a few  
other correlations that pertain to properties that are of interest in the urban  
context: closeness, centrality, and betweenness. All the correlations were  
found to be positive, and most to be quite high. The authors concluded  
that “ the more a node is connected to the surroundings, the less predictable  
the information, and therefore low string complexity results ” (ibid., 19),  
which confirmed their main hypothesis. This result has implications for the

structures of cities; for instance, when a piazza is highly accessible from the  
surrounding areas, navigation is clear and easy and therefore complexity is  
low. The combination of linkography and Space Syntax seems promising.

**The Linkograph as a Visualization Tool in Project Risk Management**

Kilian Gericke, Bj ö rn Kleinod, and Lucienne Blessing (2009) were interested  
in how risk management could be used to ensure that an engineering proj-  
ect remained on track. Their goal was to minimize the costs incurred when  
failures occur in a particular work package (a discrete phase). Such failures  
may also affect subsequent work packages; in fact, they may not be detected  
until their effects on a later work package are discovered. The aim of Ger-  
icke et al. was to easily and visually communicate the predicted failure risks  
such that special attention could be paid to sensitive work packages in an  
effort to prevent later failures. The linkograph was chosen as the means of  
representation. This was a theoretical study in which the units of analysis  
were not brief moves but rather were planned work packages along the life  
span of the project. In contrast with a standard linkograph, the time line on  
which they were indicated was time scaled.  
A linkograph was generated, the planned work packages were notated,  
and forelinks were established between each work package and all subse-  
quent work packages that, according to the plan, were to be affected by  
that work package. The cost to the affected work package if something were  
to go wrong in the earlier package was calculated. A choice among three  
cost concepts — minimum, maximum, and average cost — was offered. This  
cost was indicated in the linkograph next to the appropriate link. Work  
packages that were to be executed in parallel were notated in a column,  
one on top of the other. The equivalents of critical moves ( “ critical ” has a  
different connotation in this study; see below) were “ milestone packages ” ;  
these too were pre-determined and indicated in the linkograph. Backlinks  
in this notation were divided into two types. Type I backlinks were simply  
the links that had been established as forelinks, but in the reverse direction.  
Type II backlinks “ represent a planned iteration in the process ” (ibid., 5).  
To distinguish them from backlinks Type I, backlinks Type II were notated  
above the move, or work package line, as shown in figure 7.9.  
Gericke et al. argued that “ the later the failure is detected, the greater the  
failure costs ” (ibid., 5). Therefore, the distance of a link (in the terminology

**Further Insights 151**

of the present book, a link span) is important. To facilitate its representa-  
tion on the linkograph, a vertical axis to the left of the network was added,  
with distance marks in both directions: down, in the field of the forelinks/  
backlinks Type I, and up, in the field of backlinks Type II.  
Gericke et al. used the word “ criticality ” to indicate the predicted impact  
resulting from failure in a work package. A conceptual and dimensionless  
criticality index can be computed for every work package and can be used  
to assess the importance of monitoring it closely. The criticality index is the  
product of the duration and the cost of each work package divided by cho-  
sen affected units. The results are to be assessed by experts to ensure their  
validity. Gericke et al. asserted that the linkographic representation is easy  
to produce and easy to read, and that it offers a qualitative and quantitative  
basis for systematic risk management.

**Comparison between Solving and Designing of Well-Defined Problems**

The cognitive psychologists Geert Wissink and Saskia Jaarsveld (2002) were  
interested in differences in cognitive activity between designing and solving  
of well-defined problems, and between the first and second halves of such  
processes. Their assumptions were that more reliance on ideas generated

**Figure 7.9**

**152 Chapter 7**

earlier in the process occur in a designing task than in a solving task, that  
more different cognitive activities take place in a designing task than in a  
solving task, that more links among consecutive activities are apparent in a  
solving task than in a designing task, and that in both a designing task and  
a solving task the second phase (which is more exploratory and evaluative  
than the first) is characterized by more links among activities.  
To investigate these assumptions, Wissink and Jaarsveld carried out an  
empirical study in which two different but related tasks were given to psy-  
chology students who were instructed to “ think aloud ” while executing  
them. The study yielded 21 usable protocols. The first solving task to be  
administered was Raven ’ s Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM),^3 includ-  
ing three different tests. In the designing task, participants were asked to  
design a test item similar to the ones in the solving task. The sessions were  
recorded, and the ensuing protocols were parsed into five-second segments.  
These protocols were the basis for linkographs (the matrix version) of the  
designing and solving processes. The assumptions above were translated  
into assumed linkographic patterns and statistics as follows:

* more unlinked segments (akin to orphan moves) in the solving task than  
  in the designing task  
* more unlinked segments in the first half of the linkographs of both tasks  
* more critical segments (equivalent of critical moves) in the designing task  
  than in the solving task  
* higher link indices in the designing task than in the solving task  
* higher link indices in the second halves of the linkographs of both tasks  
* more webs and chunks and less sawtooth tracks in the designing task  
  than in the solving task

A one-way analysis of variance was employed to check for possible differ-  
ences among the three solving tasks in the mean numbers of segments, of  
links, and of link indices. Because no significant differences were found, the  
mean values could be compared with the values obtained in the designing  
task. The first comparison pertained to the number of segments. Significant  
differences were found between the tasks (the designing task took consider-  
ably longer and involved more segments). The distribution of links within  
each task was quite uneven, but with a normal overall distribution. The  
following results were obtained:

**Further Insights 153**

*Unlinked segments* The assumptions that there would be more unlinked  
segments in the solving task and more unlinked segments in the second  
halves of both tasks were not confirmed. The only significant differences  
were found in a comparison between the first and second halves of both  
tasks: for both halves the proportion of unlinked segments was smaller in  
the solving task.

*Critical segments* Critical segments were checked at the threshold level of  
five links. A small number of critical segments was found in the linkographs  
of both tasks, and especially in the solving task. I propose that the reason  
is most probably that the threshold level was too high for these tasks and  
possibly for well-defined problem-solving protocols in general.

*Link index* The assumption that the link indices of the second halves of  
both sets of linkographs would be higher than those of the first halves of  
those linkographs was confirmed for both the solving and the designing  
tasks. However, the main assumption that the mean L.I. of the designing  
task would be higher than that of the solving task was not confirmed. The  
reason may be that the number of links in these linkographs is quite low  
to begin with, in part because of a relatively high proportion of unlinked  
segments, but possibly also because of the way a link may have been estab-  
lished. The L.I. values that were obtained in this study are particularly low:  
the means vary between 0.43 and 0.72.

*Sawtooth tracks and chunks* Contrary to the assumption, more sawtooth  
tracks were found in the designing-task linkographs than in the solving-  
task linkographs. In accordance with the assumptions, more chunks were  
found in the linkographs of the designing task than in those of the solving  
task, although the difference is not statistically significant. The number of  
chunks was low, especially in the solving-task linkographs. No webs were  
found in any of the linkographs.

*Link depth* The mean link depth (link span) was measured for the two  
sets of linkographs. The designing task boasted a significantly higher link  
depth than the solving task, meaning that segments were more frequently  
linked to segments farther away in time in the designing-task than in the  
solving-task.

Although many of the assumptions were not confirmed in this study, it  
did reveal certain differences between the solving tasks and the designing  
tasks. The more significant indicators were link index, critical segments,

**154 Chapter 7**

unlinked segments, and link depth. In addition to questioning the theoreti-  
cal basis of the assumptions, we may question the logic of segmentation  
by time units, especially since in this study segments were also assigned to  
periods with no verbal activity, thus reducing the number of links and the  
resultant link index. We may also question the usefulness of linkography  
for the study of well-defined problem solving, in which the search for a  
solution involves a fixed routine. The importance of calibration (what is  
considered a segment, a link, what threshold should be used for criticality  
measures, and so on) is a major lesson to be drawn from this study.

**Comparison of Modes of Representation at the Front Edge of the Design**  
**Process**

To compare the cognitive effects of three different modes of representation  
in the early phases of designing, Benay G ü rsoy and Mine Ö zkar (2010) con-  
ducted an experiment in which three designers of equal experience solved  
three different short design problems of similar complexity. For each prob-  
lem they were allowed only one representational mode, which varied across  
problems. The modes were freehand sketching, a matchbox model (later  
developed into a cardboard model, but that phase was not analyzed), and a  
digital model. The designers were asked to think aloud. The taped verbaliza-  
tions yielded nine protocols (three per designer and three per representa-  
tion mode). The protocols were parsed into moves ranging in length from  
5.9 to 40 seconds. The total time per task, which was not restricted, also  
varied greatly across designers, the longest task being at least twice as long  
as the shortest one. Linkographs were generated for all nine design sessions.  
Because they were interested in design productivity, G ü rsoy and Ö zkar  
calculated link indices. They found considerable differences among repre-  
sentational modes and amid designers, and no coherent pattern. Next they  
derived from the linkographs lateral and vertical transformations, a distinc-  
tion based on work by Goel (1995). G ü rsoy and Ö zkar assumed that there  
was a correlation between the number of lateral transformations and the  
level of ambiguity of the design representation mode. That is, higher lateral  
transformation values should be obtained for the physical models and free-  
hand sketching than for the digital model.  
The criterion for a distinction between the modes of transformation was  
based on the distribution of links: “ dense clusters of links correspond to

**Further Insights 155**

vertical transformations while scattered links denote lateral transforma-  
tions ” (G ü rsoy and Ö zkar 2010, 7). Dense clusters of links were demarcated  
in the linkographs as triangles, each of which was considered to represent  
one lateral transformation. Unlinked moves ( “ orphan ” in our terminology)  
were added to this count, as they too were considered to be lateral transfor-  
mations. The total sum of triangles and unlinked moves was the number  
of lateral transformations. According to G ü rsoy and Ö zkar, vertical trans-  
formations were harder to determine. They adopted the idea of a Vertical  
Transformation Value (that is, the depth of the process defined as the mean  
distance of links from the *x* axis) from Kan and Gero 2008\.  
The assumption that ambiguous representation modes would yield a  
larger number of lateral transformations was not supported by the results,  
as each of the designers achieved the highest number of lateral transforma-  
tions in a different modality. There were no specific assumptions concern-  
ing the vertical transformations, but they allowed G ü rsoy and Ö zkar to  
determine how well developed each design solution was in each representa-  
tional mode. In two cases the highest values were achieved in the sketching  
mode; in the third case they were achieved in the physical model mode.  
The inconclusiveness of the results from this study may be attributable  
to several methodological difficulties. First, the small number of partici-  
pants may have been restrictive, as the authors acknowledged. Second, the  
grain of the analysis was quite coarse, the number of moves was restricted,  
and the variation in their length may have been too large. Third, at least  
one participant was not fluent using the software that was provided for dig-  
ital modeling, which must have affected that participant ’ s performance. In  
addition, the use of matchboxes for the physical model mode is question-  
able; restriction to a fixed single component is very strict; in “ regular ” phys-  
ical modeling, any number of components may be used. It is reasonable to  
assume that if the experiment were repeated with these methodological dif-  
ficulties addressed, the use of linkography might reveal differences among  
the modes of representation.

**Effectiveness of Modes of Representation**

Rosario Vidal, Elena Mulet, and Eliseo G ó mez-Senent (2004) conducted  
a relatively large-scale study that had goals quite similar to those of the  
aforementioned study by G ü rsoy and Ö zkar. Vidal and her associates were

**156 Chapter 7**

interested in the effect of what they called “ means of expression ” on the  
effectiveness of ideas generated in design brainstorming. Three variants of  
brainstorming were defined: sentential brainstorming (verbal, although  
later writing was included); visual brainstorming (sketching), and objectual  
brainstorming (in which participants prototyped their ideas using Meccano  
components). Twelve groups, each made up of five first-year industrial  
design students, were asked to design, at a conceptual level, an inexpensive  
tiltable drafting table that would take up minimal space when not in use.  
The sessions, each lasting an hour, were recorded, and a list of ideas that  
were generated was prepared for each session. All measured variables were  
expressed as means across participating groups for each variant of brain-  
storming. Links among ideas were established and notated in Excel matrix  
linkographs, in accordance with van der Lugt ’ s (2001) precedent; a linko-  
graph was constructed for each session. The unit of analysis was termed a  
“ global idea, ” meaning an idea of pronounced significance. ( “ Global ideas ”  
were chosen instead of all ideas because of the large size of the data set.)  
To measure effectiveness (which was contingent on how valid an idea  
was relative to the requirements), Vidal et al. used a coding scheme with  
three levels: valid, rejected, and not related. The significant values the  
researchers were interested in were the number and percentage of valid  
ideas. The link density (that is, the ratio between the number of links and  
the number of global ideas — equivalent to our link index) was calculated  
for each linkograph. The higher the link density, the more developed the  
idea was considered to be. The ratio between the total number of ideas and  
the number of global ideas was also calculated, to indicate how focused the  
process of idea generation was.  
The findings of this study affirmed that in functional design, at least  
when it is performed by novice designers, there are differences in the effec-  
tiveness of the design process that are related to the mode of representa-  
tion used in brainstorming, or in preliminary design sessions. The objectual  
mode emerged as the mode with the highest proportion of valid ideas, the  
highest link density, and the highest ratio of global ideas to all ideas. On  
the other hand, the sentential mode had a much higher score than the  
other modes in the number of global ideas generated. Vidal et al. concluded  
that the classic sentential variant should be used if the goal is a wide range  
of ideas, regardless of their applicability. If, however, more integrated and  
plausible ideas are sought, the objectual variant gives the best results. The

**Further Insights 157**

sketching mode was somewhere between the two other variants on almost  
all counts.

**Linkograph as Metaphor**

Hyo-Jeong Kwon, Hwa-Sei Lee, Doo-Heon Song, and Chee-Yong Kim (2008)  
were interested in specifying an appropriate search and navigation system  
for social networks and similar Web 2.0 interfaces. They claimed that a  
visual search that uses memory and visualization tools is more satisfactory  
to users than a search based on text, thumbnail icons, and screen shots.  
Visual search of a website, they wrote, is “ a searching method using visual  
navigation factors where search results are arranged in a visual connection,  
a visual relation and a visual shape ” (ibid., 379). Their claim was that since  
this type of search takes into account emotional factors, a visual search is  
most effective and popular in social network service and similar sites. Kwon  
et al. claimed that this kind of visual search is “ a good example of linkogra-  
phy design web navigation ” (ibid., 379). In their view, the linkograph is an  
example of a visual representation of information structure that combines  
a visual model with “ attention and elucidation ” factors. Therefore, they  
advanced the concept of “ linkography design ” for web navigation, where  
“ linkography ” is used “ as a metaphor of web structure analysis ” (ibid., 378).

## Epilogue

Design is like a trip. As a novice, one travels to uncharted territories, to new  
and unfamiliar lands where everything is to be discovered. As an expert,  
one often travels to a place one has visited before, yet there are always  
new sights and landscapes, some of them unexpected, that invite further  
exploration. It takes a while to put the pieces of the puzzle together, to gain  
an appreciation of the whole picture, to decipher patterns, to understand  
relationships, and to become aware of one ’ s blind spots. At its best, design  
thinking research is quite similar: an experienced researcher is able to point  
to gaps in our knowledge, and this leads to new insights, questions, and  
prospects. Such was my trip in the lengthy preparation of this book.  
At the outset, most of what I knew about design thinking was based on  
observation and personal experience. I had to turn to psychology to make  
sense not only of what experience had taught me but also of the questions  
that began to emerge. After all, psychology tries to explain mental phenom-  
ena, and design thinking is a mental phenomenon.  
Linkography emerged as a key, or rather one of the keys to a better under-  
standing of the design process and design thinking. Undoubtedly there are  
other keyholes that linkography does not open — we need a set of several  
different keys. For example, the very significant and special contribution  
of visual thinking may not be unveiled by linkography, and therefore it  
is important to acknowledge what linkography cannot do. Like any other  
methodology, linkography is good for certain things, and expectations for  
its use should be shaped accordingly. Nevertheless, linkography has been  
successful in imposing some structure on what is known about design  
thinking and framing it in a coherent way, allowing it to be inspected in  
structural and quantitative terms. Moreover, measurements have permit-  
ted qualitative interpretations and insights regarding the observed state

**160 Epilogue**

of affairs. Creative and agile researchers have also been able to employ  
linkographs in other design-related explorations, not necessarily cogni-  
tive ones, and similar uses in disciplines other than design may also be  
anticipated.  
More important to me is the theoretical basis for linkography, which has  
been built up gradually. The theory was developed in an inductive man-  
ner; that is, as evidence from empirical studies piled up, generalizations  
and conjectures were proposed. Experimental data could then be used to  
test the conjectures. A specific proposition that is raised in this book for  
the first time is the correspondence between forward and backward linking  
and divergent and convergent thinking, respectively. This notion is offered  
to cognitive psychology, which is the appropriate framework in which to  
further advance this idea. It seems to me that the study of creativity begs  
for a more fundamental inspection of this issue, and it is high time that we  
engage in it.  
Linkography, its study and its usage have been an exciting trip that is  
not over yet. As I write these lines, a mathematical treatment of linkographs  
as complex networks is being initiated. But since the book could no longer  
wait to get out into the world, the first two decades of the trip are herewith  
concluded. I hope that the coming years will see linkography grow and  
develop, with numerous creative researchers making it their own and tak-  
ing it in directions we may not be able to anticipate at present. Chapter  
7 begins to suggest the wide range of explorations for which linkography  
may prove useful. To me this would be a most rewarding outcome of this  
endeavor.

## Appendix: Sources of Data

The linkographic studies in this book are based on data derived from several  
empirical studies. In each of these studies, protocols of design sessions (or  
their equivalent) were generated and linkographic analyses were conducted  
by the author or by other researchers. The number of studies based on pro-  
tocols in which linkographs have been used is significantly larger than can  
be reported here (see chapter 7 for more on various uses of linkography);  
the eight studies featured here are the main sources for the empirical analy-  
ses in this book. They are listed in chronological order, highlighting those  
aspects that are relevant to linkography.

**Ming-Hung Wang and N. John Habraken, 1982**

**Source: Wang and Habraken 1982**  
In the fall of 1982, John Habraken and his PhD student Ming-Hung Wang  
set out to study the basic operations that they believed are sufficient to  
carry out designing, based on decisions that are being taken during the  
design process. They suggested six such operations. In an empirical study,  
they asked a designer to arrange furniture in a living and dining space in  
a student ’ s apartment, and then listed the sequence of design decisions  
that had been made from the beginning to the end of the design session.  
A report was generated, consisting of a list of 35 decisions, achieved in 24  
steps, each employing one operation. Next the operations that were car-  
ried out more or less at the same time were consolidated into a single step,  
resulting in a reduction of the number of steps to twelve. The decisions  
were subsequently coded using the six operations as the scheme of cat-  
egories (the coding scheme, although it was the main goal of the study, is

**162 Appendix**

not relevant here). They also graphed the decisions across the given form  
variants, which were nine furniture “ sites ” (e.g., dining, working, TV, blind,  
long drape). The results proved that the six operations are necessary and  
sufficient to encompass all design decisions.

**Branch library study, MIT, 1986 – 87**

**Source: eight protocols of design sessions**  
The Branch Library study was initiated in 1986 by Donald Sch ö n and  
William Porter of the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.^1 Its primary purpose was to study  
how designers make sense of design problems, which Sch ö n and Porter  
regarded as under-defined and under-structured in most cases. It was a  
grounded theory study: there were no predefined research questions and it  
was assumed that such questions would arise from analyses of the experi-  
mental data. In keeping with the study ’ s goals, Sch ö n and Porter invented  
the “ Branch Library Footprint ” design task, which was intentionally poorly  
defined and poorly structured. The task called for commentary on six  
optional entry points into a branch library, indicated on a given outline  
plan referred to as “ footprint ” ( figure A.1 ). Participants were asked to think

**Figure A.1**  
“ Footprint ” of library. Numbered arrows indicate optional entry points.

**Sources of Data 163**

aloud about the consequences of choosing a specific entry point while pro-  
posing preliminary design concepts for the library. Transcriptions of audio  
recordings and sketches produced during the sessions were used to prepare  
protocols.  
The assignment instructions were given to participants orally and were  
not formalized in writing; the following is a reconstruction:

An association that builds and operates branch libraries in suburban areas (in the  
USA) has a standard “ footprint ” for its libraries, which are single floor buildings.  
Because of changing site conditions the entry point may vary; there are six alterna-  
tive points at which the entry could be positioned that are indicated in the given  
drawing \[figure A.1\]. Could you please help the Library Association by commenting  
on the design implications of the different optional entry points?

Eight designers volunteered to participate in the experiments. Each of  
them undertook the assignment alone, in the presence of an experimenter  
(three researchers served as experimenters). There was no time limit. The  
participants spent between 30 minutes and 70 minutes completing the  
assignment. Six of the participants were affiliated with MIT. Most of them  
were full-time or part-time design teachers with different amounts of design  
experience, one was a visitor, and one was a first-year graduate student with  
an undergraduate education in chemistry. The remaining two participants  
were highly experienced, well-known European architects. Two of the pro-  
tocols were not analyzed and are therefore not featured here.  
In a follow-up task, called “ branch library II, ” six designers were asked  
to design a library for a site in a clearing with several low walls. Only two  
of the protocols were analyzed and are featured here. The two participants  
were experienced architects who were pursuing PhD degrees at MIT.  
Table A.1 summarizes the data about the participants in the two library  
design tasks.

**Delft protocol workshop, 1994**

**Sources: two protocols transcribed by Anita Clayburn Cross; Cross et al.**  
**1996**  
The Delft protocol workshop was initiated by Nigel Cross, Kees Dost, and  
Henri Christiaans in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the  
Delft University of Technology. The idea was to have a group of experienced

**164 Appendix**

design researchers analyze a set of design protocols, and then to bring them  
together “ to discuss the state of the art in protocol research ” (Cross et al.  
1996, 4). The task Cross, Dost, and Christiaans came up with called for  
the design of “ a fastening device that should allow a given backpack to be  
fastened onto a mountain bike “ (ibid., 5). The experiment took place in  
1994 at Xerox PARC (now called the Xerox Research Center) in Palo Alto.  
The eight participants (two of whom worked individually and six in two  
three-person teams) were all experienced industrial designers. The bicycle  
and the backpack were in the room in which they worked. The subjects  
were asked to think aloud, and the sessions were videotaped. They worked  
under the same conditions for two hours, after which they were debriefed  
for ten minutes.  
One team ’ s protocol and one individual ’ s protocol were selected (on  
the bases of clarity and completion of data) for analysis. These protocols,  
sketches produced during the sessions, and the video tapes of the sessions  
were sent to 19 invited design researchers (and research groups) with expe-  
rience in protocol analysis. Later in 1994 they presented their work at what  
came to be called the Delft protocol workshop. Papers from the workshop  
were published in a book (Cross et al. 1996\) and in a special issue of the  
journal *Design Studies* (volume 16, issue 2, 1995). Today researchers con-  
tinue to use the “ Delft protocols ” in various studies.

**Remko van der Lugt, 2001**

**Source: van der Lugt 2001**  
In his PhD research in industrial design engineering at the Delft University  
of Technology, Remko van der Lugt studied various methods of conducting  
idea-generation meetings at the outset of product-development tasks. The  
methods studied were all variants of brainstorming. In some sessions, the  
participants sketched; in others, only the facilitator sketched; in yet others,  
there was no sketching at all. Groups of advanced design students then  
were given two series of industrial design tasks that were facilitated accord-  
ing to the brainstorming variants. From the protocol of each session, van  
der Lugt extracted a list of ideas, which he then used as the units of analysis  
for an Excel-based linkograph. The linkographs allowed him to compare  
the groups regarding the number of links, the level at which team members  
built on each other ’ s ideas, and more.  
The linkograph from van der Lugt ’ s study that is used in this book (see  
figure 4.9) pertains to a session in which a team of five designers generated  
72 ideas in about 90 minutes. The task was to propose an accessory kit for  
a family car that would keep children in the back seat busy during a ride.

**Sources: Tatsa 2005; Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005**  
Dan Tatsa ’ s study, done in the course of his graduate work, is a “ real  
world ” study rather than a laboratory study. Tatsa was interested in the

**166 Appendix**

dynamics of idea generation in an undergraduate studio class in architec-  
ture. Assuming that such a setting is highly conducive to idea generation,  
he attended all sessions of a second-year undergraduate studio class for a  
semester and documented in detail the development of projects by eight  
students, listing the ideas raised by each student, by the teacher, and by  
fellow students. The assignment was to design a museum on the seashore  
of Tel Aviv.  
At the end of the semester, Tatsa presented each student with a list of  
all ideas related to his or her project that had been communicated in the  
studio and asked the student to assess the impact of those ideas on the  
final design. There were five levels of impact, from “ major contribution ” to  
“ negative impact. ” The two highest assessments were “ contribution ” (later  
changed to “ critical ” ) and “ major contribution (later changed to “ very criti-  
cal ” ). Table A.3 presents the data.  
Later Tatsa engaged in two rounds of linkograph generation. First he  
drew an Excel-based linkograph for each student. Since the lists of ideas  
were lengthy, this was a formidable task, and the results were used only  
for a general characterization of each student ’ s process. In the second  
round, he constructed linkographs only for the “ critical ” and “ very critical ”  
ideas in each student ’ s project. The latter process was repeated for two  
projects after links had been determined by two additional judges. Values  
extracted from these linkographs were correlated with the students ’ semes-  
ter grades.

**Source: Daum-Cohen 2008**  
Michal Daum-Cohen was interested in the arguments designers use for deci-  
sions they contemplate and eventually make. In other words, she wanted to  
explore designers ’ reasoning in the early conceptual design phase. In par-  
ticular, she wanted to compare novice and experienced designers in order  
to explore the know-how of the latter, which the former appear to not yet  
possess. As part of her graduate work, she conducted an experiment with  
ten novice (first-year) and ten more experienced (fourth-year or fifth-year)  
undergraduate architecture students. Each student was individually pre-  
sented with the same design task, which called for the redesign of a small  
vacation house.^2 The student was given 25 minutes to perform the task and  
was asked to think aloud.  
Daum-Cohen analyzed the first part of each protocol (about 8 minutes)  
which she parsed into design moves. The number of moves within this time  
frame varied significantly among participants. Later she generated Excel-  
based linkographs for each of these portions of the protocols. Figure A.2  
shows the drawing that was given to each participant with this explanation  
of the task:

You have inherited a small lot with a small house on it. The house is old and in poor  
condition and you can pull it down and build a new vacation house for yourself  
instead. As was the case in the past, building laws enable single-floor construction  
on 2/3 of the lot ’ s area. When the house was built there was a requirement for a one-  
meter clearance between the property line and any construction. The law has since  
been eased and today building right to the property line is allowed. Openings are  
allowed anywhere in the house ’ s perimeter, provided the 3 meter high party walls  
between your lot and adjoining lots remain intact.

Table A.4 presents the relevant data.  
Daum-Cohen assumed that a higher positive correlation between val-  
ues extracted from the linkographs and an independent evaluation of the  
quality of the design outcomes would be achieved by the advanced stu-  
dents. Her findings indicated that although this was the direction of the  
results, no statistically significant difference was found between advanced  
and novice students. Two possible explanations were offered. The first was  
that the difference in expertise between the two groups of students was  
not sufficiently pronounced: advanced students are still beginners and not

experts. The second was that the initial part of the process (the eight min-  
utes that were analyzed) may not be sufficiently indicative of the entire  
process.

study, he asked seven three-person teams of advanced industrial design stu-  
dents to come up with conceptual designs for a movable ashtray. The task  
was described as follows:

Since there is no suitable disposal system, cigarette stubs are an environmental prob-  
lem in outdoor areas where many people gather for an event. You are asked to design  
a mobile ashtray (not fixed to the ground or attached to an object) that can be used  
in outdoors events such as a concert or a village fair.

After the task was introduced, each team member worked alone for 15 min-  
utes and developed one or more ideas. In the next 50 minutes, members of  
the team worked together. In the next 10 minutes, they wrote down ideas  
individually. They then re-convened for 30 minutes and synthesized a joint  
solution. A short debriefing followed. The total working time, excluding  
the debriefing, was 120 minutes.  
In this book, one vignette from one of Neumann ’ s protocols is used.  
Taken from the stage in which members of the team worked together

before they had reached a final solution, it comprises 27 moves (this is  
referred to as the “ short version ” ). An extended vignette from the same  
protocol, comprising 47 moves, was also linkographed (referred to as the  
“ long version ” ) and is sometimes used — see table 4.1.

**Hagay Hochman and Itay Dafni, 2006**

**Source: Goldschmidt et al. 2010**  
Hagay Hochman and Itay Dafni were interested in the dynamics of the  
design critique ( “ crit ” ), a conversation between a student and a teacher  
about the student ’ s project in progress. Hochman and Dafni documented  
three “ crits ” in three different second-year architecture studio classes and  
produced protocols. The protocols were parsed into verbalizations by turn  
taking of the conversants (student and teacher), regardless of their lengths  
(see table A.5 ). Linkographs were then prepared from the protocols.  
Hochman and Dafni then produced a second set of linkographs, includ-  
ing only links between verbalizations by the student and the teacher and  
omitting links between verbalizations by the same party. They compared  
the resultant revised linkographs in terms of the communication dynam-  
ics. Next, they extracted critical verbalizations from each linkograph and  
calculated the percentage generated by each party. The results were com-  
pared with the participants ’ self-assessments (collected separately by means  
of questionnaires) regarding the question “ Who raises important issues in  
studio crits? ”

1. Excluding those who study the brain rather than the mind and approach the  
   topic from a neurocognitive or even a purely neurological point of view, which  
   necessitates completely different research methods.  
2. Milne ’ s informal calculation yielded a value of about 7 seconds (personal com-  
   munications, August 2010 and January 2012). Baya ’ s results ranged from 6.9 seconds  
   to 7.4 seconds in a number of studies (the equivalent term to “ move ” that Baya  
   used, and Milne adopted, was “ information fragment ” ). Kan and Gero found in one  
   study that the average duration of a segment, which is the equivalent of a move, was  
   6.6 seconds. Goldschmidt reached a value of 6.9 seconds per move in one study.  
3. [http://www.thefreedictionary.com.](http://www.thefreedictionary.com./)  
4. Previous attempts to automate this process were unsuccessful because they were  
   based entirely on word similarity, which is not enough to express actual thought  
   processes.

**172 Notes to chapters 4 and 5**

**Chapter 4**

1. The move line is a non-scaled time line, as the duration of moves varies.  
2. The protocol was recorded by Andr é Neumann in 2006 as part of his PhD research  
   in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technol-  
   ogy (see appendix).  
3. The 10 – 12% proportion was found, by trial and error, to yield the clearest picture  
   regarding the structure of a process, but in short linkographs this proportion tends  
   to be higher.  
4. The slight difference between experienced and novice designers is interesting.  
   One possible explanation is that experienced designers tend to make moves in a  
   more integrated way, so that a high number of links is distributed among more  
   moves and therefore the top 10% are responsible for a slightly lower number of  
   links, with more links associated with the next percentiles.  
5. The term “ link span ” should not be confused with the term “ degree of separa-  
   tion, ” which is used in network theory. In this book, span is an adjacency measure  
   in a sequentially ordered series. “ Degree of separation ” refers to the number of links  
   needed to connect between pre-designated nodes in a network (e.g., a social net-  
   work). Adjacency is inconsequential.  
6. The percentage increases to 80.9 if we ignore Daum-Cohen ’ s architecture stu-  
   dents, whose link-generation pattern is a little different (see figure 4.8). For informa-  
   tion about the processes that originated these calculations, see the appendix.  
7. We do not attempt to inspect link percentages at L.S. levels higher than 7, as  
   those vary significantly across cases.

**Chapter 5**

1. Since the operation typology is not our focus here, the operation types described  
   by Wang and Habraken are omitted from the current discussion.  
2. A threshold of three links yields seven critical moves, more than we would nor-  
   mally choose to inspect if adhering to the 10 – 12% rule of thumb, which would be  
   achieved at a threshold of four links. The lower threshold was chosen because it  
   yields the appropriate number of critical moves for a comparison with Wang and  
   Habraken ’ s critical path, which includes eight moves. This is a good example of the  
   benefits of a flexible threshold setting.  
3. The percentage of self-assessed critical ideas is very high in this study. The ideas  
   that were classified as “ very critical ” yield a more appropriate percentage according  
   to linkography theory. However, this is not relevant to the point made here regard-  
   ing the increase of interlinking with the (independently measured) significance of  
   the ideas to the designers.

**Notes to chapters 5–7 and appendix 173**

4. *Move 21* and then er in this tray, if we assume the tray could be injection molded,  
   ’ cause that seems to be within our cost targets.  
5. See also figure 4.6, in which this linkograph was chosen to exemplify a poorly  
   structured process.  
6. The proportion of CM^6 s is rather high. For most analyses of the Delft protocols  
   the threshold was seven links, but in this case we wanted to test a somewhat larger  
   sample and therefore the link count was conducted at a lower threshold.  
7. The 80/20 proportion should not be confused with the “ 80/20 principle ” (Pareto  
   principle), which stipulates that in many phenomena 80% of attained results are  
   attributable to 20% of investment or effort (see, e.g., Koch 1998).

**Chapter 6**

1. This is a paraphrase of a dictum by the architect Louis Kahn, who maintained  
   that there is no such thing as architecture; there are only works of architecture.  
2. Since the task was very ill-defined, some of the participants were satisfied to com-  
   ment on various aspects of it and did not attempt a complete solution.  
3. In calculating the percentage of bidirectional moves, the total number of moves  
   is taken to be *n* – 2, as the first and last moves are unidirectional by definition.

**Chapter 7**

1. A similar distinction was made by Rodgers et al. (2000), who used the scale at  
   which sketches were drawn as a yardstick for transformation type (same scale — lat-  
   eral transformation; larger scale — vertical transformation). The question of scale  
   does not come up in the study by Cai et al.  
2. The name first chosen for the program was Linkographer. Since this is the name  
   of our linkographing software, developed earlier, Pourmohamedi and Gero changed  
   the name of their system to lincoder. However, the change was not yet reflected in  
   the referenced paper.  
3. A Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) test is a 3 × 3 design: three columns of  
   three figures each, with the ninth figure absent. The progression from the top to the  
   bottom figure of each column is governed by a different rule. The task is to deduce  
   the rule for the third column and complete the missing figure (to be selected from  
   eight given possibilities).
