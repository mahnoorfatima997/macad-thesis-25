## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `thesis-agents/agents/cognitive_enhancement.py` - MAJOR OVERHAUL

**Status**: Complete rewrite (1280 → 446 lines, 65% reduction)

#### **Key Changes**:

**A. Scientific Foundation Integration**
```python
# Added linkography integration
try:
    from linkography_types import Linkograph, DesignMove, LinkographLink, CognitiveLinkographMapping
    from linkography_cognitive_mapping import CognitiveMappingService
    LINKOGRAPHY_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    LINKOGRAPHY_AVAILABLE = False
```

**B. Research-Validated Cognitive Dimensions**
```python
# Six scientifically validated dimensions (replacing generic categories)
self.challenge_templates = {
    "deep_thinking_engagement": [...],      # Target: 75%
    "cognitive_offloading_prevention": [...], # Target: 85%
    "scaffolding_effectiveness": [...],     # Target: 80%
    "knowledge_integration": [...],         # Target: 70%
    "learning_progression": [...],          # Target: 65%
    "metacognitive_awareness": [...]        # Target: 60%
}
```

**C. Baseline and Target Metrics**
```python
# Scientific baseline metrics from traditional tutoring research
self.baseline_metrics = {
    "deep_thinking_engagement": 0.35,      # Traditional tutoring baseline
    "cognitive_offloading_prevention": 0.65,
    "scaffolding_effectiveness": 0.45,
    "knowledge_integration": 0.40,
    "learning_progression": 0.30,
    "metacognitive_awareness": 0.25
}

# MEGA system target metrics
self.target_metrics = {
    "deep_thinking_engagement": 0.75,      # MEGA system targets
    "cognitive_offloading_prevention": 0.85,
    "scaffolding_effectiveness": 0.80,
    "knowledge_integration": 0.70,
    "learning_progression": 0.65,
    "metacognitive_awareness": 0.60
}
```

**D. Linkography-Based Analysis**
```python
def _generate_linkograph_from_conversation(self, state: ArchMentorState) -> Optional[Linkograph]:
    """Generate linkograph from conversation history for cognitive analysis"""
    # Extracts design moves from conversation
    # Creates semantic links between moves
    # Uses research-validated cognitive mapping formulas
```

**E. Intelligent Strategy Selection**
```python
def _select_scientific_strategy(self, cognitive_metrics: Dict[str, float], context_classification: Dict) -> str:
    """Select enhancement strategy based on weakest cognitive dimension"""
    # Finds dimension with lowest score relative to target
    # Considers context classification (overconfident, uncertain, etc.)
    # Returns appropriate challenge type
```

**F. Scientific Metrics Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_improvement_over_baseline(self, cognitive_metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Calculate improvement over baseline using research metrics"""
    # Compares current performance to traditional tutoring baseline
    # Calculates improvement percentage
    # Tracks progress toward MEGA system targets
```

### 2. `thesis-agents/orchestration/langgraph_orchestrator.py` - SYNTHESIZER FIX

**Status**: Fixed response synthesis logic

#### **Key Changes**:

**A. Improved Response Integration**
```python
# OLD: Only used cognitive enhancement as fallback
elif cognitive_result:
    final_response = cognitive_result.get("response_text", "")

# NEW: Integrates all components intelligently
response_parts = []
if domain_result and domain_result.get("response_text"):
    response_parts.append(domain_result.get("response_text", ""))
if socratic_result and socratic_result.get("response_text"):
    response_parts.append(socratic_result.get("response_text", ""))
if cognitive_result and cognitive_result.get("response_text"):
    cognitive_text = cognitive_result.get("response_text", "")
    if cognitive_text and cognitive_text not in " ".join(response_parts):
        response_parts.append(f"\n💭 **Cognitive Challenge:** {cognitive_text}")
```

**B. Clear Cognitive Challenge Labeling**
- Added `💭 **Cognitive Challenge:**` prefix
- Prevents duplication with other responses
- Maintains clear separation of content types

### 3. `thesis-agents/agents/analysis_agent.py` - PHASE DETECTION FIX

**Status**: Fixed unrealistic phase completion percentages

#### **Key Changes**:

**A. Conservative Edge Case Handling**
```python
# OLD: Defaulted to 30-50% completion
"phase_completion": 30

# NEW: Conservative early-stage percentages
"phase_completion": 8  # Very early stage
```

**B. Realistic Fallback Percentages**
```python
# OLD: 50% completion in fallback scenarios
"phase_completion": 50

# NEW: 15% completion for fallback scenarios
"phase_completion": 15  # More conservative early stage
```

**C. Updated Phase Detection Logic**
```python
# More conservative keyword-based detection
if any(word in combined_input for word in ["start", "begin", "first", "new", "what", "help", "how"]):
    phase = "ideation"
    completion = 10  # Early ideation (was 20)
elif any(word in combined_input for word in ["layout", "plan", "arrange", "space", "room", "design"]):
    phase = "visualization"
    completion = 25  # Early visualization (was 40)
# ... etc.
```
