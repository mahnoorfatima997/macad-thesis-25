It's an interesting opportunity to blend the old with the new, and create something functional yet aesthetically pleasing.\n\nGiven that you're at the initial design stage, it would be great to explore different aspects like space utilization, architectural style, and environmental considerations. Have you thought about how the existing structure of the warehouse can be leveraged in the design? What considerations are you making to make it a lively space for the community?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing more about your ideas and assisting you on this exciting journey of architectural design! \n\nTo help us explore this together, I'd love to hear your thoughts on: \n1. What is the primary purpose of your design? \n2. Who are the main users and what do they need? \n3. What do you think is the most important function this space needs to serve? \n\n**How we'll work together:** I'm here to guide you through a progressive learning journey. We'll start by understanding your interests and then explore the design space together, building your knowledge step by step. \n**Next steps:** \u2022 Share your thoughts on the questions above \u2022 Tell me more about what interests you most \u2022 Ask about any concepts you'd like to explore further \nI'm excited to explore this architectural journey with you!
