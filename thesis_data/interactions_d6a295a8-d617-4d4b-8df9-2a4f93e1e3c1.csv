Consider how these can be adapted to enhance flexibility and user experience. For instance, use columns to create open, airy spaces that allow for natural lighting and good circulation. Integrate pediments as decorative elements to maintain a visual connection to traditional Greek architecture. Ensure accessibility by designing wide, welcoming entrances and pathways. Engage the community by incorporating spaces that can host local events, fostering a sense of connection. By blending these historical elements with modern functionality, your hotel can offer both aesthetic appeal and practical benefits.
