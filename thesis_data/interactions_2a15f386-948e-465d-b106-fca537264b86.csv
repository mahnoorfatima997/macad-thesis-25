1. **Accessibility**: Prioritize features like ramps, wide doorways, and non-slip surfaces to accommodate mobility issues.
   
2. **User Experience**: Design spaces that promote relaxation and recovery, considering sensory elements like sound and scent.

3. **Flexibility**: Ensure spaces can adapt to various therapies and activities, maintaining good circulation and visual connections.

4. **Natural Lighting**: Maximize natural light to enhance well-being and create a calming environment.

5. **Community Engagement**: Incorporate spaces that encourage social interaction and community involvement.

Tailor these elements to the English countryside setting, using local materials and sustainable practices to blend with the natural landscape.

1. **Accessibility**: Prioritizing features such as ramps, wide doorways, and non-slip surfaces to accommodate mobility issues in the design of the facility.
2. **Pool Design for Physical Therapy**: Integrating accessibility features into the design of 20 pools to ensure they are suitable for physical therapy and can accommodate individuals with mobility issues.
