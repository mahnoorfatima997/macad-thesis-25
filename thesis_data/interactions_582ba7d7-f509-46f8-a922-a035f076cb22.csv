Prioritize flexibility by designing modular spaces that can adapt to various uses. Enhance user experience and circulation by incorporating wider corridors and strategically placed communal areas to break up linear layouts. Ensure accessibility by maintaining clear pathways and consider natural lighting to create a more open, inviting atmosphere. Use visual connections, such as glass partitions or open sightlines, to foster a sense of spaciousness. Integrate community engagement areas, like lounges or shared kitchens, to enhance the guest experience and prevent monotony in the layout. These strategies will help you achieve a balanced, functional design that meets your project's needs.
