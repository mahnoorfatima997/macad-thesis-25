Together, these methods reveal not just visible behaviors, but the socio-spatial relationships\u2014like informal meeting points or visual sightlines\u2014that shape how people engage with the space.\n\nWhen scaling adaptive elements across the learning center, biophilic principles can guide sensory enhancements: orienting seating toward greenery, using natural materials, maximizing daylight, or introducing water or tactile textures. This approach ensures that each intervention\u2014while flexible\u2014also fosters connection to nature, supports cognitive comfort, and enriches experiential quality.\n\nWhich adaptive feature would you prioritize first to test both movement patterns and biophilic engagement?",
