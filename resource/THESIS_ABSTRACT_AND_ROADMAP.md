# Thesis Abstract and Roadmap: ArchMentor - A Multi-Agent AI System for Cognitive Enhancement in Architectural Education

## Abstract

The rapid adoption of AI in architectural education (41% to 59% of firms in 2024-2025) has led to concerning patterns of cognitive offloading, with 74% of new graduates reporting diminished confidence in independent design skills. This thesis presents ArchMentor, a novel multi-agent AI system designed to prevent cognitive offloading and actively enhance students' cognitive development in architectural education. Unlike traditional AI tools that risk replacing student thinking, ArchMentor employs a specialized agent architecture that combines Socratic dialogue, contextual reasoning, and rich multimodal interaction to scaffold rather than supplant cognitive processes.

The system's innovation lies in its orchestrated multi-agent approach: a Context Reasoning Agent maintains situational awareness, a Knowledge Synthesis Agent provides domain expertise, a Socratic Dialogue Agent guides critical thinking, and a Cognitive Enhancement Agent ensures active learning. These agents work in concert through a sophisticated routing system that adapts to student engagement and understanding levels, ensuring responses always promote deep thinking rather than passive consumption.

Through rigorous benchmarking against traditional AI tools (including ChatGPT) and controlled studies with architecture students, we demonstrate ArchMentor's effectiveness across six novel metrics: Cognitive Offloading Prevention, Deep Thinking Engagement, Scaffolding Effectiveness, Knowledge Integration, Learning Progression, and Metacognitive Awareness. Results indicate significant improvements in students' independent design thinking capabilities while maintaining high engagement levels.

This research contributes both a practical tool for architectural education and a broader framework for developing AI systems that enhance rather than replace human cognitive capabilities.
