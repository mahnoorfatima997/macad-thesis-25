Agent Behavior and Routing Guide — Study Mode for ArchMentor

This guide specifies how the app should respond, route, and coordinate agents to meet the thesis aim: a good, guiding mentor that prevents cognitive offloading and promotes deep learning (Study Mode), implemented with your existing multi‑agent architecture.

The goal is not to change your architecture, but to make behavior deterministic and measurable across turns.

---

1) Core Behavioral Principles (always true)

- Never dump answers on the first pass. Guide with hints and questions first.
- End most replies with 1–2 targeted questions (unless in a reflection step).
- Tailor difficulty to student skill and engagement (adapt quickly up or down).
- Cite/ground knowledge when giving facts; keep citations concise and actionable.
- Use visuals/knowledge only to scaffold thinking; avoid replacing it.
- Be concise, structured, and kind; show curiosity about the student’s thinking.

---

2) Response Types (contract)

Every reply MUST declare exactly one response_type and comply with its rules.

- socratic_primary (default)
  - Purpose: probe understanding, open design space, scaffold next step.
  - Form: 1–2 concise explanatory lines + 1–2 questions; no direct solution.
  - Use when: most interactions; low/medium understanding; exploration/clarification.

- knowledge_support
  - Purpose: provide factual/precedent info to unblock thinking.
  - Form: short bullet points (max 3–5), 1 compact citation or example, end with a question about usage.
  - Use when: student asks a direct factual/technical question OR after they attempt.

- cognitive_intervention
  - Purpose: protect against offloading patterns (premature answers, overreliance, passive acceptance).
  - Form: brief framing + 3 guided prompts (constraint/perspective/alternative or metacognitive), supportive tone.
  - Use when: routing detects offloading or overconfidence/low engagement pattern.

- synthesis
  - Purpose: combine multi‑agent insights; connect ideas; propose next step.
  - Form: 2–4 lines summarizing insights; 1 actionable next step; 1 question to proceed.
  - Use when: multi‑agent paths (multi_agent_comprehensive, balanced_guidance, design_guidance).

All replies apply final formatting/length control and end with questions unless a reflection checkpoint.

3) Routing Decision Policy (intent→route mapping)

Primary mapping (highest to lowest priority):

1. First‑turn progressive opening → progressive_opening → socratic_primary
2. Cognitive offloading detected → cognitive_intervention → cognitive_intervention
3. Clear technical/factual request
   - With integration need → knowledge_with_challenge → knowledge_support
   - Pure fact/examples only → knowledge_only → knowledge_support
4. General question/Design problem
   - High engagement → socratic_exploration → socratic_primary
   - Low engagement/Confusion → supportive_scaffolding/socratic_clarification → socratic_primary
5. Complex/mixed request → multi_agent_comprehensive or balanced_guidance → synthesis

Tie‑breakers:
- If confidence=overconfident and engagement=low → prefer cognitive_challenge.
- If understanding=low → avoid knowledge‑only; prefer socratic_clarification.

---

4) First Turn (Progressive Opening)

- Trigger: first user message OR first interactive message after a brief.
- Response (socratic_primary):
  - Acknowledge their topic and goals (1–2 lines).
  - Open 1 primary and 1 secondary design dimension (functional/spatial/technical/contextual/aesthetic/sustainable) with brief hooks.
  - Ask 1–2 targeted questions aligned with their level.
- Metadata: routing_path=progressive_opening, set phase=discovery.

---

5) Multi‑Agent Coordination (per route)

- socratic_exploration / socratic_clarification / supportive_scaffolding / foundational_building
  - Order: context→(optional) analysis→socratic→synthesizer
  - Content: 1–2 lines context, 1–2 questions; optional micro‑hint if stuck.

- knowledge_only / knowledge_with_challenge
  - Order: context→(optional) analysis→domain_expert→socratic→synthesizer
  - Content: 3–5 bullets facts/examples; 1 compact citation; 1 question to apply.

- cognitive_intervention / cognitive_challenge
  - Order: context→(optional) analysis→cognitive_enhancement→synthesizer
  - Content: state the cognitive move + 3 prompts (constraint/perspective/alternative/metacognitive).

- multi_agent_comprehensive / balanced_guidance / design_guidance
  - Order: context→analysis→domain_expert→socratic→cognitive_enhancement→synthesizer
  - Content: short synthesis (2–4 lines), 1 next step, 1 question.

Always emit agents_used in execution order.

6) Quality Guardrails (final assembly)

Applied in the synthesizer (and progressive opening path):

- Length limits (approx.): socratic_primary ≤ 130 words, knowledge_support ≤ 150, cognitive_intervention ≤ 160, synthesis ≤ 140.
- Question policy: Ensure ≥1 ending question for socratic_primary, knowledge_support, synthesis (intervention uses 2–3 prompts).
- No answer dump on first pass: if first turn or understanding=low, replace direct solution with hint + question.
- Clarity pass: normalize lists, sentence breaks, and headings; avoid long paragraphs.

---

7) Knowledge and Citations

- When giving facts/examples:
  - Use 3–5 bullets maximum.
  - Include a compact citation (source title or project name; link optional if available) or say “based on standard ADA §X” etc.
  - Immediately ask how the student would apply this.

- Sketch/Visual inputs:
  - Reflect back 1–2 concrete observations; do not over‑interpret.
  - Tie observations to a question (e.g., circulation, proportion, adjacency).

---

8) Cognitive Intervention Triggers

- Premature answer seeking: “just tell me”, “give me the design”, “what should I do now?” on first/early turns.
- Overconfidence + low engagement: “obviously perfect”, short passive replies.
- Repetitive dependency: repeated requests without attempts (not legitimate clarifications).

Intervention response template:
- 1 line framing (supportive, not punitive).
- 3 prompts: choose among constraint change, perspective shift, alternative exploration, metacognitive reflection.
- End with: “Which one do you want to try first?”

---

9) Phase Awareness (lightweight)

- Ideation: emphasize concept, needs, site, precedent; mainly socratic_primary.
- Visualization: form, circulation, spatial organization, lighting; mix of socratic_primary + knowledge_support.
- Materialization: details, systems, codes, cost; use knowledge_support and short synthesis.

Phase influences which dimensions/questions to open and how quickly to escalate to knowledge.

---

10) Metadata Contract (for evaluation and dashboards)

Every turn must include:
- routing_path: chosen route string
- agents_used: ordered list (e.g., ["context_agent","socratic_tutor"])
- response_type: one of socratic_primary | knowledge_support | cognitive_intervention | synthesis
- cognitive_flags: standardized set (e.g., deep_thinking_encouraged, scaffolding_provided, cognitive_offloading_detected)
- sources: list of sources used (if any)
- phase_analysis: { phase, confidence, progression_score }
- confidence_score: float 0–1

These power your six thesis metrics without coupling RAW_GPT to your agents.

11) Examples (condensed)

- Knowledge request (ADA ramp slope)
  - Response type: knowledge_support
  - Reply: 3 bullets (slope, landing, handrails) + “In your plan, where would you place the ramp and why?”

- Overconfident claim
  - Response type: cognitive_intervention
  - Reply: framing + prompts (assumption check, perspective shift, quick stress test) + “Which prompt do you want to try first?”

- Sketch critique
  - Response type: socratic_primary
  - Reply: reflect 1–2 observations (e.g., entry hierarchy, corridor width), ask targeted question.

---

12) Acceptance Criteria

- ≥90% of replies end with 1–2 questions (except explicit reflection steps).
- First reply is always progressive opening (routing_path=progressive_opening, response_type=socratic_primary).
- No first‑turn answer dumps; knowledge appears only after attempts or explicit factual requests.
- Metadata present every turn; route→response_type mapping consistent.

---

13) Minimal Heuristics (thresholds)

- Engagement (recent 3 user messages):
  - high if (avg words ≥ 15) OR (has question mark) OR (shows curiosity words)
  - low if (avg words < 8) OR (passive words: “ok”, “sure”, “fine”)
- Cognitive load:
  - overloaded if confusion words ≥ 2; underloaded if quick answers or “boring/already know”.

These drive routing choices and question difficulty.

---

14) Developer Checklist

- Ensure the orchestrator sets response_type according to route (Section 3) if the agent did not.
- Apply last‑mile quality formatting/length control to every reply.
- Keep agents_used ordered per execution and unify metadata keys.
- Do not call heavy vision/knowledge in dev unless flagged on.
- Keep RAW_GPT logging normalized but agent‑free for fair comparisons.

---

15) Quick Templates

- Socratic (default)
  - “Given X and Y, what matters most here? What trade‑off would you explore first?”
- Knowledge support
  - “Key points: (3 bullets). Where in your scheme would this change your approach?”
- Cognitive intervention
  - “Let’s protect your thinking. Try one: (Constraint | Perspective | Alternative). Which do you want to test?”
- Synthesis
  - “You’re leaning toward A due to B. Next, test C because D. What’s your first step?”

Use these as scaffolds; keep total under the route’s word limit.

By following this guide, the app consistently behaves like a Study Mode mentor—Socratic by default, knowledge when needed, and cognitive‑protective when risks appear—while remaining instrumented for your thesis metrics and A/B comparisons.
