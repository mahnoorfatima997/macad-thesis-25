## 💡 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Sequential Testing:**
1. **Start with progressive_opening** (first message)
2. **Build context** with 2-3 follow-up messages
3. **Trigger gamification** on 4th message or with strong triggers
4. **Test different routes** by varying question types
5. **Check context continuity** across conversation
6. **Test cognitive offloading prevention** with lazy requests

### **Route Priority Verification:**
- **Higher priority routes** should override lower priority ones
- **Gamification triggers** should override normal routing when detected
- **Confusion expressions** should get immediate attention (priority 5)
- **First messages** should always use progressive_opening (priority 1)

### **Agent Coordination Testing:**
- **Single agent routes**: knowledge_only → domain_expert only
- **Multi-agent sequential**: socratic_exploration → multiple agents
- **Full coordination**: multi_agent_comprehensive → all agents
