## 🔧 Major System Changes

### 1. Analysis Agent Optimization & Compaction

#### **File: `thesis-agents/agents/analysis_agent.py`**

**Changes Made:**
- **Removed 600+ lines** of over-engineered code
- **Eliminated complex phase detection systems** (`_initialize_phase_indicators`, `_initialize_phase_weights`)
- **Removed unused methods** (`assess_cognitive_state`, test functions)
- **Simplified building type detection** (replaced complex system with keyword matching)
- **Streamlined synthesis logic** (basic cognitive challenge detection)

**New Features Added:**
- **Unified LLM Analysis**: `_analyze_with_llm()` method for comprehensive analysis
- **Intelligent Phase Detection**: `detect_design_phase_llm()` with completion percentages
- **Robust JSON Parsing**: `_extract_json_from_response()` to handle markdown-wrapped JSON
- **Fallback Building Type Detection**: `_detect_building_type_fallback()` using keyword matching
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better JSON parsing and edge case management

**Key Improvements:**
```python
# Before: Complex phase detection with 600+ lines
# After: Streamlined LLM-based analysis
async def _analyze_with_llm(self, state: ArchMentorState, combined_input: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Single LLM call for comprehensive analysis
    # Returns: phase_analysis, text_analysis, synthesis, cognitive_flags
```

**Token Limits Increased:**
- `max_tokens` increased from 300 to 800 to prevent cut-off responses
- Better response quality and completeness

### 2. User Interface Improvements

#### **File: `mega_architectural_mentor.py`**


**Display Improvements:**
- **Phase Display**: Shows current design phase instead of confidence percentage
- **Building Type Display**: Properly capitalized and formatted
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of phase completion
- **Human-Readable Analysis**: Replaced technical JSON with user-friendly descriptions

**New Features:**
- **Phase Progress Section**: Detailed information about current phase
- **Force Fresh Analysis Button**: Manual trigger for re-analysis
- **Debug Section**: Human-readable analysis details (removed raw JSON)

---

### 3. Progress Tracking System Implementation

#### **Automatic Progress Updates:**
- **Real-time Tracking**: Progress updates after each chat interaction
- **Phase Advancement**: Automatic detection of phase transitions
- **Completion Percentages**: Dynamic calculation based on conversation depth

#### **Manual Progress Control:**
- **Update Progress Button**: Manual trigger for progress recalculation
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear display of current phase and completion

#### **Progress-Advancing Questions:**
**Phase-Specific Guidance:**

**Ideation Phase:**
- "What is the main purpose of this building?"
- "Who are the primary users and what are their needs?"
- "What are the key functional requirements?"

**Visualization Phase:**
- "How should the spaces be organized and connected?"
- "What is the circulation flow between different areas?"
- "How can natural light be maximized?"

**Materialization Phase:**
- "What construction methods would be most appropriate?"
- "What materials would work best for this project?"
- "How can sustainability be integrated?"

**Completion Phase:**
- "What final details need to be resolved?"
- "How can the presentation be improved?"
- "What are the key design highlights?"

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes

#### **Building Type Detection Issue:**
**Problem**: Interface showed "Project Type: Unknown" despite correct terminal output
**Root Cause**: Analysis running without user messages, triggering edge case handler
**Solution**: Added user message to state before analysis to trigger LLM analysis

```python
# Fix applied in analyze_design method
state.messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": f"I'm working on my {design_brief.lower()} and need help with the design process."}
]
```

#### **Phase Key Inconsistency:**
**Problem**: `analysis_agent.py` returned `current_phase` but other files expected `phase`
**Solution**: Updated all files to consistently use `current_phase`
**Files Updated:**
- `cognitive_enhancement.py`
- `langgraph_orchestrator.py`
- `interaction_logger.py`

#### **Watchdog Error (Windows):**
**Problem**: `ValueError: Paths don't have the same drive` from watchdog library
**Solution**: Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with `fileWatcherType = "none"`

#### **Repetitive Text Issue:**
**Problem**: Hardcoded cognitive summary appearing at end of every response
**Solution**: Removed automatic cognitive summary appending in `langgraph_orchestrator.py`

---

### 5. Code Quality Improvements

#### **Error Handling:**
- **JSON Parsing**: Robust handling of markdown-wrapped JSON responses
- **Edge Cases**: Better handling of short/empty inputs
- **Fallback Systems**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for building type detection

#### **Debugging:**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added debug prints throughout analysis process
- **Session State Debugging**: Added debug output for session state issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress update logging

#### **Code Organization:**
- **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate code and unused methods
- **Simplified Logic**: Streamlined complex conditional statements
- **Better Documentation**: Added clear comments and docstrings
