# Yesterday's Changes Summary - August 7, 2025

## Overview
Focused consolidation and refinements across the multi‑agent stack, routing, and testing. Key work centered in `thesis-agents` with complementary tests and docs. Multiple interaction datasets were generated as part of verification runs.

## ✅ Highlights
- **Routing reliability improvements** in `thesis-agents/utils/routing_decision_tree.py`
- **Agent consistency updates** in `thesis-agents/agents/` (context, domain expert, socratic tutor)
- **Workflow robustness** in `thesis-agents/orchestration/langgraph_orchestrator.py`
- **Conversation phase logic** refinements in `thesis-agents/conversation_progression.py`
- **Expanded tests** for routing, response quality, and web search
- **Documentation** updates: routing patterns, response quality, metrics/links, milestones
- **Data collection runs** produced interactions, moves, linkography, and metrics files

## Changes in thesis-agents

### Orchestration
- `thesis-agents/orchestration/langgraph_orchestrator.py`
  - Hardened orchestration flow and error paths
  - Better alignment with standardized agent response structures

### Agents
- `thesis-agents/agents/context_agent.py`
  - Improved intent/context recognition for cleaner routing inputs

- `thesis-agents/agents/domain_expert.py`
  - More consistent knowledge responses and metadata
  - Alignment with standardized LLM call pattern

- `thesis-agents/agents/socratic_tutor.py`
  - Incremental refactor toward LLM‑driven scaffolding and challenge prompts
  - Consistent response types and flags

### Conversation progression
- `thesis-agents/conversation_progression.py`
  - Phase detection/transition logic adjustments for reliability during multi‑turn sessions

### Routing utilities
- `thesis-agents/utils/routing_decision_tree.py`
  - Enhanced rule coverage for: clarification, knowledge‑with‑challenge, cognitive intervention
  - Tuned confidence thresholds and labeling for downstream agents

## Tests added/updated (verification)
- `test_routing_simple.py` / `test_routing_debug.py` / `test_ongoing_routing.py` / `test_routing_in_app.py`
  - Verify routing paths and debug outputs
- `test_enhanced_routing.py` / `test_enhanced_routing_patterns.py`
  - Validate updated routing patterns and decisions
- `test_enhanced_response_quality.py`
  - Check guidance quality and response structure
- `test_enhanced_web_search.py`
  - Validate external information integration patterns
- `test_conversation_compatibility.py`, `test_classification_fix.py`, `test_data_flow.py`, `test_progression_data.py`, `test_integration.py`, `test_milestone_system.py`
  - Broader integration and data‑flow checks

## Documentation updated
- `ENHANCEMENT_PROGRESS.md`
- `RESPONSE_LENGTH_AND_CONTEXT_FIXES.md`
- `METRICS_AND_WEB_LINKS_FIXES.md`
- `RESPONSE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- `MILESTONE_PROGRESS_TRACKING_GUIDE.md`
- `TWO_MILESTONE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `ROUTING_TEST_QUESTIONS.md`
- `ENHANCED_ROUTING_PATTERN_RESULTS.md`

These documents capture rationale, expected behaviors, verification steps, and future work for routing and response quality.

## Data generated (verification runs)
Multiple files in `thesis_data/` were generated, including:
- `interactions_*.csv`, `moves_*.csv`, `design_moves_*.csv`
- `full_log_*.json`, `session_summary_*.json`
- `linkography/linkography_*.json`, `linkography_moves_*.jsonl`
- `metrics_*.csv`

Use these to validate routing, agent balance, and progression metrics.

## How to verify quickly
- Run routing tests: `test_routing_simple.py`, `test_enhanced_routing.py`
- Spot‑check agent outputs for standardized fields (response_type, cognitive flags)
- Review `ENHANCED_ROUTING_PATTERN_RESULTS.md` against current test outputs
- Inspect latest `interactions_*.csv` for conversation flow and labeling

## Impact
- More reliable routing and clearer agent responsibilities
- Standardized responses improve UI integration and logging
- Stronger test coverage reduces regression risk
- Richer datasets support analysis of learning/progression signals

## Next steps
- Finalize LLM call standardization across all agents
- Extend routing test corpus with more edge cases
- Tighten phase progression thresholds based on new datasets
- Document any remaining deviations from standardized `AgentResponse`
