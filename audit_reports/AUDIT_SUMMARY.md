- Check color scheme compliance
- Review technical documentation accuracy

---

## Generated Reports

All audit reports have been saved in the `/audit_reports/` folder:

### 1. **COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md**
**Purpose**: Main audit report covering all system components  
**Key Findings**:
- System uses legitimate real data with scientific baselines
- 8-step benchmarking pipeline functioning correctly
- Some thresholds require empirical validation
- Data consistency issues identified in ~50 sessions

### 2. **DATA_INTEGRITY_DETAILED_FINDINGS.md**
**Purpose**: Deep dive into data quality and consistency issues  
**Key Findings**:
- Only 6 sessions have complete data across all components
- 90.6% of sessions missing linkography analysis
- 81.25% of sessions missing evaluation reports
- 3 corrupted linkography files requiring regeneration

### 3. **THRESHOLD_VALIDATION_REQUIREMENTS.md**
**Purpose**: Documentation of all hardcoded values needing validation  
**Key Findings**:
- 37 hardcoded thresholds identified
- 4 critical thresholds affecting research validity
- GNN using pseudo-labels instead of ground truth
- Proficiency thresholds lack empirical basis

## Overall System Assessment

### ✅ **Strengths**
- **Real Data Usage**: System captures and processes genuine user interactions
- **Scientific Baselines**: Uses peer-reviewed research for comparisons
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive technical details provided
- **Color Compliance**: Strict adherence to thesis color palette
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Mathematical formulas correctly implemented

### ⚠️ **Areas Requiring Attention**
- **Data Completeness**: Only 9.4% of sessions fully processed
- **Threshold Validation**: Critical thresholds need empirical validation
- **Pipeline Reliability**: Processing failures not properly handled
- **Data Organization**: Mixed naming conventions and unclear archival

### ❌ **Critical Issues**
1. **GNN Pseudo-labels**: Using synthetic labels for model training
2. **Missing Analyses**: 50+ sessions lack required processing
3. **Hardcoded Thresholds**: Proficiency levels based on estimates

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Sessions Audited | 64 |
| Complete Data Sets | 6 (9.4%) |
| Dashboard Sections Verified | 13/13 |
| Mock Data Found | 0 |
| Hardcoded Thresholds | 37 |
| Color Compliance | 100% |
| Scientific Baselines | 4 validated |

---

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 days)
1. Regenerate linkography for 3 corrupted files
2. Process evaluation reports for recent sessions
3. Clean duplicate backup files

### Short-term (1 week)
1. Batch process all missing analyses
2. Implement pipeline monitoring
3. Standardize session naming convention

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
1. Conduct threshold validation study with experts
2. Replace GNN pseudo-labels with ground truth
3. Implement automated quality checks

## Conclusion

The MEGA Architectural Mentor benchmarking system demonstrates **strong fundamental architecture** with **legitimate data processing**. The system successfully avoids mock data and implements scientifically-grounded analysis methods. However, to achieve full research-grade reliability, the system requires:

1. **Complete data processing** for all collected sessions
2. **Empirical validation** of classification thresholds
3. **Ground truth labels** for machine learning components
4. **Improved pipeline reliability** with monitoring and recovery

**Overall Verdict**: The benchmarking dashboard displays **reliable, non-mocked data**, but requires completion of downstream processing and threshold validation for full research validity.
