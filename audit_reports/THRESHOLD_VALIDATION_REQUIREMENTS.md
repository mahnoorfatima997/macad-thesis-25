---

## 1. Critical Thresholds Requiring Validation

### 1.1 Proficiency Classification Thresholds

**Location**: `benchmarking/user_proficiency_classifier.py`

| Threshold | Current Value | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Expert | ≥ 0.85 | Composite score for expert classification | Determines highest proficiency level |
| Advanced | ≥ 0.65 | Composite score for advanced classification | Key progression milestone |
| Intermediate | ≥ 0.45 | Composite score for intermediate classification | Baseline competency marker |
| Beginner | < 0.45 | Composite score for beginner classification | Entry level designation |

**Current Implementation**:
```python
if composite_score >= 0.85: return 'expert'
elif composite_score >= 0.65: return 'advanced' 
elif composite_score >= 0.45: return 'intermediate'
else: return 'beginner'
```

**Validation Requirements**:
1. Collect expert assessments from 3+ architectural educators
2. Analyze score distributions from actual student populations
3. Perform ROC curve analysis to optimize thresholds
4. Validate against external assessment tools

**Recommended Methodology**:
- Inter-rater reliability study (Cohen's kappa > 0.7)
- Sensitivity/specificity analysis for each threshold
- Cross-validation with established proficiency tests

### 1.2 Graph Neural Network Pseudo-Labels

**Location**: `benchmarking/graph_ml_benchmarking.py`

| Threshold | Current Value | Purpose | Risk |
|-----------|--------------|---------|------|
| Beginner cutoff | < 0.4 | Learning score threshold | Misclassification of struggling learners |
| Advanced cutoff | ≥ 0.7 | Learning score threshold | Overestimation of expertise |

**Current Implementation**:
```python
if avg_learning < 0.4: label = 0  # Beginner
elif avg_learning < 0.7: label = 1  # Intermediate  
else: label = 2  # Advanced
```

**Critical Issue**: These are entirely synthetic labels with no ground truth basis

**Validation Requirements**:
1. Replace with human-annotated labels
2. Collect ground truth from student assessments
3. Validate against learning outcomes
4. Calibrate with instructor evaluations

|-----------|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| similarity_threshold | 0.35 | Semantic similarity for link creation | Empirical study on design move relationships |
| max_link_range | 15 | Maximum distance between linked moves | Analysis of actual design session patterns |
| orphan_threshold | 3 | Consecutive orphans indicating struggle | Validation against expert linkography analysis |
| sawtooth_window | 5 | Window for pattern detection | Optimization through pattern recognition study |

**Validation Requirements**:
1. Expert linkographer annotations (minimum 20 sessions)
2. Sensitivity analysis for threshold variations
3. Pattern validation against published linkography studies
4. Optimization using F1 scores

## 2. Default Values and Fallbacks

### 2.1 Interaction Logger Defaults

**Location**: `thesis-agents/data_collection/interaction_logger.py`

            reflection_markers * 0.2 + 
            pause_patterns * 0.2)

## 9. Documentation Requirements

For each validated threshold, document:

1. **Original Value**: The hardcoded value being replaced
2. **Validation Method**: How the new value was determined
3. **Sample Size**: Data used for validation
4. **Confidence Level**: Statistical confidence in the value
5. **Sensitivity Range**: Acceptable variation range
6. **Review Schedule**: When to revalidate

**Template**:
```python
# Threshold: proficiency_expert
# Original: 0.85 (heuristic)
# Validated: 0.823 (95% CI: 0.79-0.86)
# Method: ROC optimization on 47 expert annotations
# Sensitivity: ±0.03 maintains 90% accuracy
# Review: Annual or after 100 new sessions
PROFICIENCY_EXPERT_THRESHOLD = 0.823
```

## Conclusion

The system contains **37 hardcoded thresholds** requiring validation, with **4 critical thresholds** that directly impact research validity. The highest priority is replacing GNN pseudo-labels and validating proficiency classification thresholds.

**Estimated Timeline**: 5 weeks for complete validation
**Resource Requirements**: 3-5 domain experts, 30+ annotated sessions
**Expected Outcome**: Research-grade validated thresholds with documented confidence levels

Without threshold validation, the system's research conclusions remain questionable despite using real data. These validation studies are essential for thesis credibility.
