## 2. Response Type Analysis

### Response Format Structure Analysis

| Response Type | Synthesis Structure | Bullet Points | Sections | Gamification Support |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| knowledge_only | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| balanced_guidance | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

### Expected vs Actual Output Formats

#### ‚úÖ **Balanced Guidance** (Working Correctly)
```
Synthesis:

- Insight: Hot climate community centers require careful attention to passive cooling...
- Watch: Don't simply copy solutions - adapt principles to your specific climate...
- Direction: Start by analyzing your site's wind patterns, sun angles, and local materials...
```

#### ‚úÖ **Knowledge Only** (Working Correctly)
```
Passive cooling strategies include natural ventilation, thermal mass, and shading. 
These techniques reduce energy consumption by using environmental conditions.
```

#### ‚úÖ **Socratic Clarification** (Working Correctly)
```
Let me help clarify spatial hierarchy. Think about how you move through a building - 
what spaces feel most important? What draws your attention first?
```
