# 🧠 Design Thinking Studio

## Overview

The **Design Thinking Studio** transforms your architectural analysis system into an interactive, guided design process that helps users think through their design decisions rather than providing direct answers. This approach fosters deeper learning and more thoughtful design outcomes.

## 🎯 Philosophy

### From Direct Answers to Guided Discovery

**Traditional Approach (Your Current System):**
- Upload image → Get immediate analysis → Receive direct critique → Suggestions provided
- **Problem:** Users become dependent on AI answers, don't develop their own thinking

**Design Thinking Approach (New System):**
- Upload image → Guided through questions → User develops insights → AI supports thinking
- **Benefit:** Users develop critical thinking skills and deeper understanding

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The Design Thinking Process

The app guides users through six phases of design thinking:

1. **🔍 Discover** - Understand context and constraints
2. **🎯 Define** - Identify key problems and opportunities  
3. **💡 Ideate** - Generate creative solutions
4. **🔧 Prototype** - Create and test solutions
5. **🧪 Test** - Evaluate and refine solutions
6. **🤔 Reflect** - Learn from the process

### Question-Based Learning

Instead of giving answers, the system asks thoughtful questions that:

- **Encourage observation** - "What do you notice about the spatial organization?"
- **Promote analysis** - "How do environmental factors influence this design?"
- **Foster synthesis** - "How could you reorganize spaces to better serve users?"
- **Support evaluation** - "What feedback would you expect from users?"
- **Enable reflection** - "What did you learn about your design process?"

## 🚀 Getting Started

**User Response:** "Balancing open space with private areas while maintaining good flow."

**System Feedback:**
- ✅ "Your analysis demonstrates critical thinking."
- 💡 "Good use of reasoning to support your analysis."
- 🤔 "How would you prioritize these competing needs?"

### Phase 3: Ideate

**Question:** "How could you reorganize the spaces to better serve the users?"

**User Response:** "Create flexible partitions that can open or close based on needs."

**System Feedback:**
- ✅ "Your synthesis shows creative problem-solving."
- 💡 "This demonstrates innovative thinking about adaptability."
- 🤔 "What are the trade-offs of this approach?"

## 🔧 Configuration
