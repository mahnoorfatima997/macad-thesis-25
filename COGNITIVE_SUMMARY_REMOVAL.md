# Cognitive Assessment Summary Removal

## What Was Changed

The "COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT SUMMARY" section that was appearing at the end of multi-agent responses has been removed. This summary included metrics like:
- Current Phase
- Cognitive Profile (Engagement, Complexity, Reflection scores)
- Key Insights
- Quick Tips

## Why It Was Removed

The cognitive assessment summary was:
1. Unnecessary for the user experience
2. Potentially distracting from the actual architectural guidance
3. Making responses longer and more cluttered
4. Better suited for internal tracking rather than user-facing output

## What Was Modified

### File: `thesis-agents/orchestration/langgraph_orchestrator.py`

Removed three instances where `cognitive_summary` was being appended to responses:

1. **Lines 1169-1174**: Removed cognitive summary addition when only Socratic guidance is available
2. **Lines 1179-1180**: Removed cognitive summary from cognitive enhancement responses  
3. **Lines 1195-1199**: Removed the general logic that added cognitive summary to other response types

## Important Notes

1. **Cognitive data is still being tracked** - The removal only affects what the user sees
2. **Metadata still contains cognitive metrics** - For research and analysis purposes
3. **The cognitive enhancement agent still works** - It just doesn't append the summary
4. **Benchmarking data collection is unaffected** - All metrics are still logged

## Verification

The responses will now be cleaner and more focused on architectural guidance without the cognitive assessment metrics. The cognitive data is still available in:
- Session logs
- Metadata
- Benchmarking analysis
- CSV exports

This change improves the user experience while maintaining all the research data collection capabilities.
