## ðŸ“‹ **TESTING PROTOCOL**

### **Step 1: Test Routes**
1. Start fresh conversation
2. Use a progressive opening sentence
3. Follow with sentences from each route category
4. Note which route is taken for each

### **Step 2: Test Gamification Triggers**
1. Use setup context (mention community center project)
2. Try each gamification trigger sentence
3. Note if gamification activates and what type

### **Step 3: Test Non-Triggers**
1. Use design exploration questions
2. Verify they DON'T trigger gamification
3. Confirm they get direct, helpful responses

### **Step 4: Test Error Handling**
1. Try edge cases and unusual inputs
2. Verify no crashes or error messages
3. Confirm graceful fallbacks work
