Based on the user examples, here are the patterns that should be added:

ROLE-PLAY PATTERNS (add these):
- 'thinking about how'
- 'how.*feel' (regex pattern)
- 'member.*feel' (regex pattern)
- 'design feel'
- 'feel from'

PERSPECTIVE PATTERNS (add these):
- 'from.*perspective' (regex pattern)
- 'teenager.*perspective' (regex pattern)
- 'design.*perspective' (regex pattern)

CONSTRAINT PATTERNS (add these):
- 'need.*ideas' (regex pattern)
- 'fresh.*ideas' (regex pattern)
- 'ideas.*design' (regex pattern)

CURRENT ISSUE:
The patterns are too specific. User language is more varied.
Need broader patterns that catch the intent, not exact phrases.

RECOMMENDED FIX:
Use regex patterns or broader keyword matching instead of exact phrase matching.
