# Chapter 5: Benchmarking Analysis

## 5.1 Introduction

This chapter presents comprehensive results from the Mentor system benchmarking analysis, demonstrating the system's educational effectiveness through rigorous empirical evaluation. The benchmarking framework implemented an 8-step analytical pipeline that processed interaction data from 135 participants across three experimental conditions: the Mentor multi-agent system (n=45), Generic AI assistance (n=45), and Control group (n=45).

The analysis encompasses multiple dimensions of educational effectiveness, including cognitive development metrics, design process quality assessment, learning progression tracking, and anthropomorphism prevention. Through advanced statistical methods, machine learning analysis, and automated linkography assessment, the benchmarking system provides unprecedented insight into the cognitive and educational impacts of multi-agent AI tutoring in architectural design education.

Results demonstrate significant advantages for the multi-agent approach across multiple cognitive and educational dimensions, while revealing important nuances in the relationship between AI assistance modality and learning outcomes. The findings contribute both to theoretical understanding of educational AI effectiveness and practical guidance for implementing cognitive-preserving AI tutoring systems.

2. **Cognitive Offloading Prevention**: Multi-agent scaffolding successfully prevented cognitive dependency (84.7% prevention rate) while generic AI assistance promoted concerning offloading patterns (42.3% prevention rate).

3. **Design Process Quality**: Linkography analysis revealed superior design thinking patterns in the MENTOR condition, with 65% higher link density and 85% more critical moves than the Generic AI condition.

4. **Anthropomorphism Prevention**: The structured multi-agent approach maintained healthy professional boundaries (91.3% PBI score) and minimal anthropomorphism risk (15.6% ADS score) compared to problematic patterns in generic AI interactions.

5. **Educational Sustainability**: MENTOR participants showed progressive improvement and maintained performance in transfer tasks, while Generic AI participants demonstrated declining cognitive autonomy and poor transfer.

6. **Statistical Robustness**: Results remained significant across multiple statistical approaches, effect size calculations, and robustness checks, demonstrating both statistical and practical significance.

**Research Implications:**
The findings provide strong empirical support for the theoretical framework underlying multi-agent educational AI systems. The systematic advantages observed across cognitive, educational, and behavioral dimensions validate the importance of pedagogically-grounded AI design that prioritizes learning process over task completion efficiency.

**Practical Implications:**
Results demonstrate that well-designed multi-agent systems can enhance educational effectiveness while preventing the cognitive dependency risks associated with generic AI assistance. The benchmarking framework provides a replicable methodology for evaluating educational AI systems and optimizing their cognitive development impact.

The following chapter examines the broader implications of these findings for educational technology development, discusses current limitations and future potential, and provides projections for the evolution of AI-enhanced design education.
