# Chapter 2: Agents & System Architecture

## 2.1 Introduction

The Mentor system represents a paradigmatic shift from traditional single-agent AI tutoring systems to sophisticated multi-agent architectures specifically designed for higher education. This chapter details the system's architectural design, agent specialization strategies, coordination mechanisms, and the theoretical foundations underlying multi-agent educational orchestration.

Unlike generic AI assistants that provide direct answers or single-purpose tutoring systems focused on specific domains, the Mentor system employs five specialized agents working in coordinated fashion to provide comprehensive educational support while preventing cognitive offloading and maintaining student agency in the learning process. The architecture demonstrates how distributed artificial intelligence can enhance educational effectiveness through role specialization, adaptive coordination, and context-sensitive intervention strategies.

        'design_phase': identify_design_phase(user_input),
        'interaction_type': classify_interaction(user_input),
        'confidence_level': assess_student_confidence(user_input),
        'prior_context': retrieve_conversation_history()
    }
    return context_data
```

**Educational Foundation**: The Context Agent's design reflects situated cognition theory, which emphasizes the importance of contextual factors in learning effectiveness (Brown et al., 1989). By establishing rich contextual understanding, the agent enables subsequent agents to provide appropriately situated educational support.

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "context_agent",
    route_decision_function,
    {
        "socratic_exploration": "socratic_tutor",
        "knowledge_delivery": "domain_expert", 
        "cognitive_intervention": "cognitive_enhancement",
        "deep_analysis": "analysis_agent"
    }
)

# Response synthesis
workflow.add_edge("socratic_tutor", "synthesizer")
workflow.add_edge("domain_expert", "synthesizer")
workflow.add_edge("cognitive_enhancement", "synthesizer")
```

**State Management System:**
The system maintains comprehensive conversational state across agent interactions:

```python
@dataclass
class ConversationState:
    # Context tracking
    current_topic: str = ""
    topic_history: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    route_history: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    # Student modeling
    detected_building_type: str = ""
    building_type_confidence: float = 0.0
    student_competence_level: str = "beginner"
    
    # Educational progression
    current_phase: str = "ideation"
    milestones_achieved: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    learning_objectives: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    # Cognitive monitoring

        'feedback_request': classify_feedback_seeking(context),
        'cognitive_offloading': detect_dependency_patterns(interaction_history),
        'deep_analysis_needed': assess_complexity_requirements(context)
    }
    
    # Route selection based on highest confidence classification
    primary_route = max(confidence_scores, key=confidence_scores.get)
    
    # Secondary agent coordination
    if confidence_scores[primary_route] > 0.8:
        return single_agent_route(primary_route)

```python
class ResponseSynthesizer:
    def synthesize_multi_agent_response(self, agent_responses, context):
        # Coherence analysis
        coherence_score = self.assess_response_coherence(agent_responses)
        
        # Educational alignment
        educational_value = self.evaluate_educational_impact(agent_responses, context)
        
        # Response integration
        if coherence_score > self.COHERENCE_THRESHOLD:
            return self.integrate_responses(agent_responses)
        else:

- **Performance Testing**: System scalability and response time optimization

**Quality Metrics:**
```python
class SystemQualityAssurance:
    def validate_educational_response(self, response, context):
        quality_metrics = {
            'pedagogical_appropriateness': self.assess_educational_value(response),
            'cognitive_challenge_level': self.evaluate_difficulty(response, context),
            'coherence_score': self.measure_response_coherence(response),
            'dependency_risk': self.assess_offloading_potential(response)
        }
        return QualityAssessment(quality_metrics)
```
