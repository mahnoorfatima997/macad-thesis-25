## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **HEXACO Personality Analysis**
- **6 personality traits**: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness
- **3 intensity levels**: Low, Medium, High for each trait
- **Scientific reliability**: Based on research with α coefficients 0.83-0.88

### 2. **Multi-Modal Analysis Approach**
- **Primary**: BERT transformer model (`Minej/bert-base-personality`)
- **Fallback**: Linguistic pattern analysis for when BERT unavailable
- **Minimum text requirement**: 500 characters for reliable analysis
- **Quality validation**: Confidence scoring and reliability assessment

### 3. **Rich Visualization Suite**
- **Radar charts**: Complete HEXACO personality profiles
- **Bar charts**: Individual trait levels with confidence indicators
- **Evolution tracking**: Trait changes across sessions
- **Correlation heatmaps**: Relationships between personality traits
- **PNG asset display**: Visual artwork corresponding to personality levels

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- **5 analysis tabs**:
  1. 🧠 **Personality Overview**: Main profiles and individual analysis
  2. 📊 **Trait Evolution**: Changes over time
  3. 🎨 **Visual Correlations**: PNG assets and trait relationships
  4. 🏗️ **Architectural Preferences**: Design preference predictions
  5. 📈 **Cognitive Correlations**: Personality-cognitive metric relationships

### 5. **Data Processing Pipeline**
- **Automatic session detection**: Finds and processes all available interaction data
- **Text extraction**: Intelligently extracts user input from CSV files
- **Batch processing**: Handles multiple sessions efficiently
- **Quality validation**: Ensures sufficient data for reliable analysis
- **Results storage**: Structured JSON format with comprehensive metadata

## 🎨 Visual Assets Integration

Your existing PNG assets in `assets/personality_features/` are fully integrated:
- **18 images** covering all HEXACO traits and levels
- **Automatic correlation**: Personality results mapped to appropriate artwork
- **Dashboard display**: Visual representations shown alongside analysis
- **Consistent styling**: Follows your thesis color palette throughout

## 📊 Analysis Capabilities

### Individual Session Analysis:
- Complete HEXACO personality profile
- Dominant trait identification
- Natural language personality summary
- Confidence and reliability metrics
- Visual artwork correlations

### Cross-Session Insights:
- Personality trait evolution over time
- Correlation patterns between traits
- Statistical summaries and trends
- Comparative analysis capabilities

### Design Preference Predictions:
- Architecture-specific personality correlations
