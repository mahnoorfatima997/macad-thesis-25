## 🔍 What Happens Automatically

When you run `python benchmarking/run_benchmarking.py`, **Step 9** now includes:

### ✅ **Automatic Validation**
- Tests all personality analysis modules
- Validates BERT model availability  
- Checks data directories
- Confirms color scheme integration
- Runs sample text analysis

### ✅ **Complete Analysis Pipeline**
- Finds all available session data
- Extracts personality traits using HEXACO model
- Generates individual session profiles
- Creates aggregate summaries
- Performs correlation analysis
- Validates result quality

### ✅ **Results Generation**
- Saves personality profiles as JSON files
- Creates visualization-ready data
- Generates correlation reports
- Provides quality metrics

## 🎯 Expected Output

```
Step 9: Performing personality analysis...
  Running personality analysis validation...
    ✓ All personality modules imported successfully
    ✓ Analyzer initialized: BERT=True, Fallback=True  
    ✓ Text analysis working: 6 traits analyzed
    ✓ Data directories ready
    ✓ Color scheme integration working
    ✓ Personality analysis validation passed
  Initializing personality analyzer...
  Analyzing personality for session 1/3: abc123...
  Analyzing personality for session 2/3: def456...
  Analyzing personality for session 3/3: ghi789...
  Generating personality analysis summary...
  [INFO] Mean analysis reliability: 0.75
[OK] Personality analysis complete for 3 sessions
```

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### If Step 9 fails validation:
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- **Import errors**: Check that you're in the right directory
- **No session data**: Ensure `thesis_data/` contains interaction CSV files

### If BERT models fail to download:
- Personality analysis will automatically use **fallback linguistic analysis**
- Still provides scientifically valid HEXACO personality traits
- Reliability may be slightly lower but analysis remains useful
