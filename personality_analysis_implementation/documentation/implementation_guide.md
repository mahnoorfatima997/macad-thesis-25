## Step 1: Install All Dependencies

Install all required packages using the main requirements file:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\aponw\OneDrive\Escritorio\MaCAD Thesis\macad-thesis-25"

# Install all dependencies (includes personality analysis requirements)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Personality Analysis Dependencies (now included in main requirements.txt):**
- `transformers` - BERT personality models
- `torch` - PyTorch backend  
- `scikit-learn` - ML utilities
- `accelerate` - Performance optimization
- `textstat` - Text analysis utilities

---

## Step 2: Run Complete Analysis Pipeline

Execute the benchmarking pipeline with automatic personality analysis validation and processing:

```bash
python benchmarking/run_benchmarking.py
```

**New Step 9 Output (with integrated validation):**
```
Step 9: Performing personality analysis...
  Running personality analysis validation...
    ✓ All personality modules imported successfully
    ✓ Analyzer initialized: BERT=True, Fallback=True
    ✓ Text analysis working: 6 traits analyzed
    ✓ Data directories ready
    ✓ Color scheme integration working
    ✓ Personality analysis validation passed
  Initializing personality analyzer...
  Analyzing personality for session 1/X: session_id...
  Generating personality analysis summary...
  [INFO] Mean analysis reliability: 0.75
[OK] Personality analysis complete for X sessions
```

**Generated Files:**
```
benchmarking/results/personality_reports/
├── session_[session_id]_personality.json       # Individual session profiles
├── personality_summary_all_sessions.json       # Aggregate summary
└── personality_cognitive_correlations.json     # Correlation analysis
```

---

## Step 3: Launch Dashboard

Start the Streamlit dashboard to access the new personality analysis section:

```bash
streamlit run benchmarking/benchmark_dashboard.py
```

**New Dashboard Section:**
1. Navigate to sidebar
2. Select **"Personality Analysis"** (between Anthropomorphism Analysis and Linkography Analysis)
3. Explore the 5 personality analysis tabs:
   - 🧠 **Personality Overview**: HEXACO profiles and individual session analysis
   - 📊 **Trait Evolution**: Changes across sessions
   - 🎨 **Visual Correlations**: PNG asset displays and trait heatmaps
   - 🏗️ **Architectural Preferences**: Design preference predictions
   - 📈 **Cognitive Correlations**: Personality-cognitive metric relationships

---

## Step 4: Data Analysis and Interpretation

### Understanding the Results

**HEXACO Personality Traits:**
1. **Honesty-Humility (H)**: Sincerity, fairness, modesty
2. **Emotionality (E)**: Anxiety, fearfulness, sentimentality
3. **eXtraversion (X)**: Social boldness, sociability, liveliness
4. **Agreeableness (A)**: Forgiveness, gentleness, cooperation
5. **Conscientiousness (C)**: Organization, diligence, perfectionism
6. **Openness (O)**: Creativity, curiosity, unconventionality

**Score Interpretation:**
- **Low (0.0-0.33)**: Below average expression of trait
- **Medium (0.34-0.66)**: Balanced/average expression
- **High (0.67-1.0)**: Above average expression of trait

**Reliability Indicators:**
- **High Confidence (>0.7)**: Reliable analysis based on sufficient text
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**: Moderate reliability, interpret with caution
- **Low Confidence (<0.5)**: Limited text data, results may be unreliable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Personality analysis modules not available"**
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn
```

**2. "No session files found for personality analysis"**
- Ensure `thesis_data/` directory contains interaction CSV files
- Files should be named: `interactions_*session*.csv`
- Check that files contain user text data

**3. "Low analysis reliability scores"**
- Increase minimum text length in sessions
- Ensure interaction data contains actual user input (not system messages)
- Consider running more comprehensive data collection

**4. "Asset files not found"**
- Verify `assets/personality_features/` directory exists
- Ensure PNG files are named correctly: `hexaco_[trait]_[level].png`
- Check file permissions and accessibility

**5. Model download issues**
- Ensure internet connection for first-time BERT model download
- Models are cached locally after first download
- Fallback linguistic analysis available if BERT fails

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Model Selection

Edit `personality_analyzer.py` to use different personality models:

```python
# Use alternative model
analyzer = PersonalityAnalyzer(model_name="Nasserelsaman/microsoft-finetuned-personality")

# Or configure in PersonalityProcessor
processor = PersonalityProcessor(analyzer=custom_analyzer)
```

### Adjusting Analysis Parameters

Modify `personality_models.py` configuration:

```python
PERSONALITY_CONFIG = {
    'min_text_length': 500,        # Minimum characters for analysis
    'confidence_threshold': 0.7,   # Minimum confidence for high-quality results
    'reliability_threshold': 0.6,  # Minimum reliability score
    'max_batch_size': 16          # Batch processing size
}
```

### Custom Color Schemes

Update trait colors in `personality_visualizer.py`:

```python
TRAIT_COLORS = {
    'honesty_humility': '#custom_color',
    'emotionality': '#custom_color',
    # ... etc
}
```

## Performance Considerations

**Memory Usage:**
- BERT models: ~500MB RAM
- Processing: ~100MB per batch of sessions
- Results storage: ~1MB per 100 sessions

**Processing Time:**
- BERT analysis: ~2-5 seconds per session
- Fallback analysis: ~0.1 seconds per session
- Visualization generation: ~1 second per chart

**Recommendations:**
- Run analysis during off-peak hours for large datasets
- Use GPU acceleration if available (`pip install torch[cuda]`)
- Consider batch processing for 50+ sessions

---

## Data Privacy and Ethics

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Personality analysis is performed on anonymous session data
- No personally identifiable information is stored with personality profiles
- Results are aggregated and anonymized for research purposes

**Research Ethics:**
- Analysis follows established psychological research practices
- HEXACO model is scientifically validated and cross-culturally reliable
- Results should be interpreted as research insights, not clinical assessments
- Consider informed consent for personality analysis in future studies
