# Metrics Display Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Linkography Metrics Not Displaying
**Problem**: The sidebar showed zeros for all linkography metrics (Design Moves, Total Links, Link Density, Move Diversity).

**Root Cause**: The `get_linkography_metrics()` method wasn't returning the expected field names that the dashboard was looking for.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `linkography_logger.py` to return metrics with correct field names:
  - Added `total_moves` (was missing)
  - Added `total_links` (was missing) 
  - Added `move_diversity` calculation
  - Included all other metrics with proper defaults

### 2. Cognitive Metrics Not Displaying
**Problem**: The Cognitive Metrics section in the sidebar showed nothing.

**Root Cause**: The `get_session_summary()` method returned `cognitive_scores` but the dashboard was looking for `cognitive_metrics`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `logging_system.py` to include both `cognitive_scores` and `cognitive_metrics` in the summary for compatibility

### 3. Linkography Generation Issues
**Problem**: The linkography logger had several compatibility issues with the benchmarking linkography types.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed `sequence_number` from LinkographyMove creation (not a valid field)
- Added required fields: `session_id`, `user_id`
- Fixed modality mappings to use valid values ('verbal' instead of 'voice')
- Fixed `to_dict()` method calls by manually creating dictionaries
- Updated save methods to properly serialize linkograph data

## How Metrics Work Now

### Linkography Metrics
When design moves are logged during a test session:
1. Each move is converted to a LinkographyMove
2. The linkography engine calculates semantic links between moves
3. Metrics are updated in real-time:
   - **Total Moves**: Count of all design moves
   - **Total Links**: Number of connections between moves
   - **Link Density**: Average links per move (indicates cognitive engagement)
   - **Move Diversity**: Variety of move types (analysis, synthesis, etc.)

### Cognitive Metrics
These are calculated based on the test condition and interactions:
- **COP (Cognitive Offloading Prevention)**: How well the system prevents direct answer-seeking
- **DTE (Deep Thinking Engagement)**: Based on linkography density and critical moves
- **SE (Scaffolding Effectiveness)**: How well the system adapts to skill level
- **KI (Knowledge Integration)**: Link density weighted
- **LP (Learning Progression)**: Improvement over time
- **MA (Metacognitive Awareness)**: Reflection move ratio

## Verification

You can verify metrics are working by:
1. Running a test session and making some design moves
2. Checking the sidebar - metrics should update after each interaction
3. Running `python verify_metrics_update.py` to test the system

## Data Flow

1. User interaction â†’ Design move created
2. Move logged to both `session_logger` and `linkography_logger`
3. Linkography engine calculates links using semantic embeddings
4. Metrics updated and displayed in sidebar
5. Data saved to CSV and JSON files for benchmarking analysis

## Files Modified

- `thesis_tests/linkography_logger.py` - Fixed metric calculation and move conversion
- `thesis_tests/logging_system.py` - Added cognitive_metrics field to summary
- Both files now properly integrate with the benchmarking system

The metrics should now update in real-time during test sessions, providing immediate feedback on cognitive engagement and design thinking patterns.
