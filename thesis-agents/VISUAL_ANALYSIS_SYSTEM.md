# Visual Analysis System - Complete Guide

## How Visual Analysis Works in Your Multi-Agent System

### **1. Image Upload & Initial Analysis**

**Where it happens:** `app.py:183-248`
- ✅ User uploads image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) via Streamlit interface
- ✅ Image saved to `./uploads/` directory  
- ✅ `VisualArtifact` created and attached to `ArchMentorState`
- ✅ Analysis Agent processes image with GPT-4V via `SketchAnalyzer`

**What gets analyzed:**
- Design strengths and weaknesses
- Identified architectural elements
- Spatial relationships
- Areas for improvement

### **2. Analysis Agent Processing**

**Where it happens:** `analysis_agent.py:172-196`
- ✅ Visual analysis runs ONCE at the beginning
- ✅ Results stored in `analysis_result["visual_analysis"]`
- ✅ Enhanced with knowledge base search using visual elements
- ✅ Creates key insights and cognitive flags for other agents

**Example output:**
```python
{
    "design_strengths": ["Clear circulation paths", "Good natural lighting"],
    "improvement_opportunities": ["Accessibility needs attention", "Scale unclear"],
    "identified_elements": ["entrance", "corridor", "main space"],
    "confidence_score": 0.8
}
```

### **3. NEW: Visual Context Sharing (ENHANCED)**

**Where it happens:** `langgraph_orchestrator.py:204-216`
- ✅ **FIXED**: Visual analysis now shared with ALL agents
- ✅ Stored in `student_state.agent_context['visual_insights']`
- ✅ Available throughout entire conversation
- ✅ Agents can reference sketch during ongoing dialogue

**What agents now have access to:**
- Design strengths noted in the sketch
- Improvement opportunities identified  
- Architectural elements detected
- Flag indicating if visual analysis is available

### **4. Agent Integration (NEW)**

**Domain Expert (`domain_expert.py:411-423`)**
- ✅ Can reference visual insights when providing examples
- ✅ Examples can connect to specific elements in the sketch
- ✅ Responses acknowledge what was seen in the drawing

**Example enhanced response:**
```
"Based on your sketch showing clear circulation paths, here are examples of courtyard designs that enhance the spatial flow you've started:

1. Central courtyard at [Example] - demonstrates how your circulation concept can be enhanced with natural ventilation...
2. Linear courtyard design - builds on the spatial organization visible in your sketch...

How might you integrate the lighting concepts we discussed with the spatial layout shown in your sketch?"
```

### **5. Conversation Modes**

#### **Mode 1: Image + Text Brief** ✅ FULLY SUPPORTED
- Upload sketch + write design brief
- Visual analysis runs automatically
- All agents have visual context throughout conversation
- Agents can reference specific sketch elements

#### **Mode 2: Text Brief Only** ✅ FULLY SUPPORTED  
- Write design brief without image
- System works normally but without visual insights
- Agents focus on conceptual discussions
- No sketch references in responses

#### **Mode 3: Ongoing Visual References** ✅ NOW AVAILABLE
- After initial analysis, agents remember sketch throughout conversation
- Can say "I notice in your sketch..." during any response
- Visual insights inform all knowledge provision and examples
- Maintains sketch awareness across multiple conversation turns

### **6. Visual Analysis Lifecycle**

```
1. IMAGE UPLOAD → 2. INITIAL ANALYSIS → 3. STORE IN STATE → 4. SHARE WITH AGENTS → 5. ONGOING REFERENCE
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓                  ↓                    ↓
   app.py          analysis_agent.py    state_manager.py   orchestrator.py    domain_expert.py
                                                                                socratic_tutor.py
```

### **7. Technical Implementation**

**Visual insights structure:**
```python
visual_insights = {
    'design_strengths': ['strength1', 'strength2'],
    'improvement_opportunities': ['area1', 'area2'], 
    'identified_elements': ['element1', 'element2'],
    'has_visual_analysis': True  # or False
}
```

**Agent access pattern:**
```python
visual_insights = state.agent_context.get('visual_insights', {})
if visual_insights.get('has_visual_analysis'):
    # Use visual context in responses
    strengths = visual_insights.get('design_strengths', [])
    # Generate sketch-aware responses
```

### **8. Benefits of Enhanced Visual System**

✅ **Persistent Visual Memory**: Agents remember sketch throughout conversation
✅ **Contextual Examples**: Examples connect to actual sketch elements  
✅ **Sketch-Aware Dialogue**: "I see in your drawing..." responses
✅ **Visual-Text Integration**: Combines sketch insights with text discussion
✅ **Flexible Modes**: Works with or without images

### **9. Example Conversation Flow**

**User:** Uploads courtyard sketch + "How can I improve airflow?"
**Analysis:** Identifies "central courtyard, unclear ventilation paths"
**Domain Expert:** "I notice your sketch shows a central courtyard - excellent start! Here are ventilation strategies that build on your spatial layout..."
**User:** "Can you give another example?"
**Domain Expert:** "Here's another approach that would work with the courtyard orientation visible in your sketch..."

The system now maintains visual awareness throughout the entire educational conversation!
