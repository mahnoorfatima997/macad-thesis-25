Knowledge Delivery ‚Üí Real-World Connection ‚Üí Exploration Invitation

"Biophilic design is our attempt to heal the disconnect between humans and nature through architecture. At its core, it's about designing spaces that support our biological need for natural connection.

Think of it like this: Your hospital courtyards aren't just 'outdoor spaces' - they're therapeutic tools. Natural light filtering through leaves, the sound of water, views to sky and horizon - these aren't aesthetic choices, they're neurological interventions that can actually accelerate healing.

The research shows patients with nature views recover 30% faster than those staring at walls.

*leans forward with curiosity*

So now I'm wondering... what kind of healing do you want your courtyards to support? Physical recovery? Emotional wellbeing? Family gathering? Different intentions might lead to very different design strategies..."

Thinking Reflection ‚Üí Insight Amplification ‚Üí Design Territory Expansion

"I love how you're thinking about courtyards as social catalysts, not just pretty outdoor spaces. You're recognizing that architecture doesn't just house activities - it actively shapes how people relate to each other.

What you're touching on is something architects call 'social affordances' - the way spaces invite or discourage certain kinds of human interaction.

*thinking together*

This makes me curious about the spectrum of social needs in a hospital:
- Patients who crave connection and community
- Families who need private emotional space
- Staff who need quick restoration between intense work
- Visitors who feel uncertain and need wayfinding cues

What if we played with this? If you could design three different courtyard 'personalities' - one social butterfly, one wise listener, one gentle supporter - how might they each look and feel different?

What's your instinct about which personality your patients need most?"

## üß† **BEHAVIOR TRACKING INTEGRATION IN ROUTES**

### **Example: Enhanced COGNITIVE_INTERVENTION with Tracking**
```python

## üéØ **KEY CORRECTIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### **‚úÖ Route Consolidation**:
- **Merged DESIGN_GUIDANCE into SOCRATIC_EXPLORATION** - no redundancy
- **14 total routes** (removed duplicate functionality)

### **‚úÖ Language Corrections**:
- **Removed "technical questions"** - now covers ALL types of questions
- **Questions can be about**: design concepts, spatial principles, user experience, cultural considerations, sustainability, materials, process methodology, precedents, theory

### **‚úÖ Enhanced Behaviors**:
- **All routes** now have Study Mode-style interactive patterns
- **Multi-agent coordination** detailed for each route
- **Cognitive metrics optimization** aligned with research goals

This gives you the complete 14-route system with proper agent coordination and flexible question handling!
