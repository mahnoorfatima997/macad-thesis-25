HOW WE AIM TO DO THE TEST TO COMPARE RESULTS LATER BETWEEN OUR TOOL, CHATGPT AND HUMAN
(calculations are done by benchmarking system which gets the exports from interaction_logger.py and there is a button to export session in mega_architectural_mentor.py)

Executive Summary
This comprehensive testing suite is designed to evaluate the Multimodal AI Mentor across three phases (Ideation, Visualization, Materialization) with integrated cognitive benchmarking. The tests are engineered to maximize the potential of the cognitive benchmarking tool by incorporating the six key metrics: Cognitive Offloading Prevention (COP), Deep Thinking Engagement (DTE), Scaffolding Effectiveness (SE), Knowledge Integration (KI), Learning Progression (LP), and Metacognitive Awareness (MA).

Main Task
Prompt: "You are tasked with designing a community center for a diverse urban neighborhood of 15,000 residents. The site is a former industrial warehouse (150m x 80m x 12m height). Consider: community needs, cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and adaptive reuse principles."

2. Knowledge Synthesis Trigger: "What are some successful examples of warehouse-to-community transformations you're aware of?"
3. Socratic Questioning: "Why might the existing industrial character be valuable to preserve? What would be lost if we completely transformed it?"
