# Metrics and Web Links Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Analysis Metrics Showing as "Unknown" or "0%"

**Problem**: The UI was displaying "Current Phase ‚ùì Unknown 0% complete", "Learning Balance üîÑ Starting 0 challenges, 0 opportunities", and "Project Type Unknown Not specified".

**Root Cause**: The UI was incorrectly accessing conversation progression data from `analysis_result.get('conversation_progression', {})` instead of `result.get('conversation_progression', {})`.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `mega_architectural_mentor.py` (lines 1604-1606)
- **Change**: Updated the milestone display section to correctly access conversation progression data from the top level of the result dictionary
- **Before**: `conversation_progression = analysis_result.get('conversation_progression', {})`
- **After**: `conversation_progression = result.get('conversation_progression', {})`

### 2. Web Search Not Providing Links

**Problem**: Domain Expert agent was returning 0 web search results, leading to AI-generated content without links.

**Root Cause**: The web search query generation was creating extremely long and complex queries that overwhelmed search engines.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `thesis-agents/agents/domain_expert.py` (lines 194-232)
- **Change**: Simplified the `generate_context_aware_search_query` function to create more focused, effective queries
- **Improvements**:
  - Reduced query complexity by limiting architectural sources to 3 key sites
  - Removed redundant search modifiers and excessive context
  - Added query length limit (200 characters) to prevent overwhelming search engines
  - Simplified building type context addition

## Technical Details

### Conversation Progression Data Flow

The conversation progression data flows correctly through the system:

1. **ConversationProgressionManager** generates progression data with:
   - `current_phase`: The current conversation phase (discovery, exploration, etc.)
   - `conversation_summary`: Contains project context, challenges, opportunities
   - `milestone_guidance`: Contains current milestone and progress information

2. **LangGraphOrchestrator** passes this data in the result:
   ```python
   return {
       "response": final_response,
       "metadata": response_metadata,
       "routing_path": routing_path,
       "classification": classification,
       "conversation_progression": progression_analysis,
       "milestone_guidance": milestone_guidance
   }
   ```

3. **UI** now correctly accesses this data:
   ```python
   conversation_progression = result.get('conversation_progression', {})
   conversation_summary = conversation_progression.get('conversation_summary', {})
   project_context = conversation_summary.get('project_context', {})
   ```

### Web Search Query Generation

The simplified query generation now creates focused queries like:
- **Before**: `"community center site:dezeen.com OR site:archdaily.com OR site:archello.com OR site:architectural-review.com OR site:architecturaldigest.com OR site:architectmagazine.com OR site:architecturalrecord.com OR site:architect.org projects examples case studies built works completed"`
- **After**: `"community center site:dezeen.com OR site:archdaily.com OR site:archello.com"`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Metrics Display

1. Start the app: `python mega_architectural_mentor.py`
2. Enter a design brief: "Design a sustainable community center for an urban neighborhood"
3. Send a message: "I need help with site analysis"
4. **Expected Results**:
   - Current Phase should show: "üîç Discovery" with progress percentage
   - Learning Balance should show challenges and opportunities
   - Project Type should show: "Community Center" with complexity level
   - Phase Progress should show meaningful progress

### 2. Test Web Links

1. Ask for examples: "Can you give me examples of sustainable community centers?"
2. **Expected Results**:
   - Response should include actual web links to architectural websites
   - Links should be in markdown format: `[Project Name](URL)`
   - Content should be from real architectural projects, not AI-generated

### 3. Test Conversation Progression

1. Continue the conversation with follow-up questions
2. **Expected Results**:
   - Metrics should update as the conversation progresses
   - Phase should advance from Discovery to Exploration
   - Milestone progress should increase
   - Project context should remain consistent

## Verification Commands

Run these test scripts to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Test conversation progression data flow
python test_data_flow.py

# Test milestone system
python test_milestone_system.py

# Test progression data
python test_progression_data.py
```

## Expected Output

The test scripts should show:
- ‚úÖ Conversation progression data being generated correctly
- ‚úÖ UI calculation functions working properly
- ‚úÖ Project context being extracted from design brief
- ‚úÖ Challenges and opportunities being generated based on current phase
- ‚úÖ Phase progress being calculated correctly

## Files Modified

1. **mega_architectural_mentor.py**
   - Fixed conversation progression data access in milestone display section
   - Ensured all UI sections correctly access data from result dictionary

2. **thesis-agents/agents/domain_expert.py**
   - Simplified web search query generation
   - Reduced query complexity and length
   - Improved search result filtering

## Next Steps

If the metrics are still showing as unknown/0%, check:
1. That the conversation progression data is being generated (run test scripts)
2. That the orchestrator is passing the data correctly
3. That the UI is receiving the data in the expected format

If web links are still not appearing, check:
1. That the web search is returning results (check terminal logs)
2. That the search query is not too complex
3. That the result processing is preserving original URLs
