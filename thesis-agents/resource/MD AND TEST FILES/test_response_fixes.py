    Hi there, thank you ‚Äî I'm excited to start this journey too.
    To begin, the primary purpose of my design is to create a vibrant and inclusive community hub that serves as a shared space for learning, recreation, celebration, and support. I want it to be a place where people from all walks of life feel welcome and represented.

    The main users are the residents of a diverse urban neighborhood ‚Äî that includes families, young people, seniors, immigrants, artists, and local organizations. Their needs vary widely: flexible spaces for workshops and meetings, quiet zones for study or counseling, recreational areas, and venues for cultural events.

    The most important function the space needs to serve is connection ‚Äî social connection, cultural exchange, and access to resources. The architecture should support that through clear circulation, inclusive programming, and warm, adaptable spaces that reflect the community's identity.

    Now, thinking about the site:

    It's a former industrial warehouse (150m x 80m, 12m high), so structurally, I'm working with large open spans and a significant vertical volume, which is great for flexible planning.

    Located in a dense urban neighborhood, the site is likely surrounded by mixed-use buildings. That means street-level activation and visual permeability are key ‚Äî the center shouldn't feel closed-off.

    Given its size and former use, I'll need to assess environmental remediation, and possibly consider daylighting strategies since warehouses often have limited window openings.

    The flatness of the site is an advantage for accessibility and circulation, and the existing industrial shell offers potential for adaptive reuse ‚Äî both for sustainability and community memory.

    I'll also look into zoning constraints ‚Äî particularly for public occupancy, egress, and parking requirements ‚Äî though I imagine much of the traffic will be pedestrian and public transit-based.

    Southern exposure may help optimize natural lighting if I can open up the fa√ßade or roof ‚Äî possibly introducing clerestories or light wells.

    My next step is to do a more detailed opportunity and constraint mapping, and start defining how the existing warehouse structure might influence my layout strategies.
