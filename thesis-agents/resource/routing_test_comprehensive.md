## üîß TESTING PROTOCOL

### **Step 1: Test Each Input**
1. Copy each test input above
2. Paste into chat interface
3. Record actual routing result from metadata
4. Compare with expected result

### **Step 2: Document Failures**
For each failed test, record:
- Input text
- Expected route
- Actual route  
- Agents activated
- Response type

### **Step 3: Pattern Analysis**
Look for patterns in failures:
- Are all knowledge requests being misclassified?
- Is intent extraction working?
- Are routing patterns too broad/narrow?
