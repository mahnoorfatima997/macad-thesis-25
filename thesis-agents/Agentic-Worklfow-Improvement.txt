Comprehensive Logic Improvement List for ArchMentor Agent Interactions
üéØ Overview
Transform agent interactions from passive information delivery to active cognitive development through research-based educational strategies that prevent cognitive offloading while promoting genuine understanding.

üõ°Ô∏è COGNITIVE PROTECTION SCENARIOS
Scenario 1: Premature Example Request
User Interaction: Student asks for examples in first 1-3 messages ("show me examples of community centers")
Current Problem: System provides examples immediately, enabling cognitive offloading
Improved Logic:

First, detect insufficient exploration (< 3 meaningful exchanges)
Ask foundation-building questions about their current understanding
Require them to articulate the challenge they're facing
Only provide examples after they've demonstrated thinking engagement
Response Pattern: "Let's explore your thinking first ‚Üí What's your current understanding? ‚Üí What challenges are you facing? ‚Üí Now here are examples that build on your insights"

Scenario 2: Direct Answer Seeking
User Interaction: Student asks "what should I do?" or "tell me the best approach"
Current Problem: System provides direct recommendations, bypassing student's thinking process
Improved Logic:

Detect direct answer-seeking language patterns
Redirect to reasoning development questions
Guide them to identify decision factors themselves
Help them develop their own criteria for "best"
Response Pattern: "Instead of telling you what to do ‚Üí What factors should influence this decision? ‚Üí What trade-offs are you willing to make? ‚Üí Based on your analysis, what seems most appropriate?"

Scenario 3: Passive Acceptance
User Interaction: Student responds with "okay," "sure," "whatever works," "I guess"
Current Problem: System continues without addressing passive learning patterns
Improved Logic:

Detect passive language indicators
Interrupt the pattern with engagement questions
Require active participation before proceeding
Build confidence through guided discovery
Response Pattern: "I notice passive responses ‚Üí Let's engage your thinking ‚Üí What's your initial instinct? ‚Üí What would you try if you weren't worried about being wrong?"


üìö DOMAIN EXPERT ENHANCEMENT SCENARIOS
Scenario 4: Example Request After Sufficient Exploration
User Interaction: Student asks for examples after 3+ meaningful exchanges exploring concepts
Current Approach: Provides list of projects with basic descriptions
Improved Logic:

Provide 2-3 contrasting approaches (not just project names)
Focus on underlying PRINCIPLES and STRATEGIES
Include discovery questions that promote pattern recognition
Connect back to their specific design challenge
Response Pattern: "Approach 1: [Strategy] works because [principle] ‚Üí Approach 2: [Different strategy] works because [different principle] ‚Üí What patterns do you notice? ‚Üí How might these principles apply to your project?"

Scenario 5: Technical Question Request
User Interaction: Student asks about codes, standards, or technical requirements
Current Approach: Provides technical information directly
Improved Logic:

Provide technical information with educational framing
Connect technical requirements to design decision-making
Ask how technical constraints influence their design approach
Promote understanding of WHY requirements exist
Response Pattern: "Here are the requirements ‚Üí These exist because [reasoning] ‚Üí How do these constraints influence your design options? ‚Üí What opportunities do these requirements create?"

Scenario 6: Follow-up Example Request
User Interaction: Student says "can you give me another example?" or "more examples?"
Current Approach: Provides additional projects
Improved Logic:

Acknowledge their engagement with previous examples
Provide different approaches that show variety
Ask comparative analysis questions
Focus on principle extraction rather than project accumulation
Response Pattern: "I see you're exploring this further ‚Üí Here are different approaches ‚Üí How do these compare to the previous examples? ‚Üí What principles are emerging across all these approaches?"


ü§î SOCRATIC TUTOR ENHANCEMENT SCENARIOS
Scenario 7: Student Shows Confusion
User Interaction: "I'm confused," "I don't understand," "this is unclear"
Current Approach: Asks generic clarification questions
Improved Logic:

Assess level and type of confusion
Break down complex concepts into manageable parts
Use scaffolding questions that build understanding step-by-step
Validate their confusion as normal part of learning
Response Pattern: "Confusion is normal in complex design ‚Üí Let's break this down ‚Üí What part feels clearest to you? ‚Üí Let's build from there ‚Üí What's one small aspect you can understand?"

Scenario 8: Student Shows Overconfidence
User Interaction: "Obviously the best approach is..." or "It's clearly..." or "This will definitely work"
Current Approach: Accepts student's confidence at face value
Improved Logic:

Detect overconfidence language patterns
Challenge assumptions without attacking confidence
Ask for evidence and reasoning
Introduce complexity and alternative perspectives
Response Pattern: "I hear confidence in your approach ‚Üí What evidence supports this? ‚Üí What might a critic say? ‚Üí What alternatives did you consider and reject? ‚Üí How would this work in different contexts?"

Scenario 9: Responding to Domain Expert Examples
User Interaction: Student receives examples from Domain Expert and responds
Current Approach: Socratic Tutor generates independent questions
Improved Logic:

Reference the specific examples that were just provided
Ask analysis questions about those exact examples
Promote comparison and pattern recognition
Connect examples to their specific project context
Response Pattern: "Looking at [specific example mentioned] ‚Üí What makes this approach effective? ‚Üí How does this compare to [other example mentioned]? ‚Üí Which aspects are most relevant to your project context?"

Scenario 10: Student Asks Meta-Questions
User Interaction: "Why are you asking me questions?" or "Can you just tell me?"
Current Approach: Continues with standard Socratic approach
Improved Logic:

Explain the educational reasoning behind questioning
Connect questioning to their learning and development goals
Show how questions build stronger thinking skills
Offer choice in learning approach while maintaining educational value
Response Pattern: "Questions help build your reasoning skills ‚Üí Direct answers would rob you of learning ‚Üí Questions help you develop expertise that lasts ‚Üí Would you like to understand why this approach helps you learn?"


üîÑ MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION SCENARIOS
Scenario 11: Comprehensive Response Needed
User Interaction: Complex design feedback request or multi-faceted question
Current Approach: Agents work somewhat independently
Improved Logic:

Domain Expert provides knowledge foundation with discovery focus
Socratic Tutor builds on that knowledge with targeted questions
Cognitive Enhancement challenges assumptions and promotes metacognition
Synthesis creates coherent learning experience
Response Pattern: "Knowledge foundation with principles ‚Üí Questions that deepen understanding of those principles ‚Üí Challenges that expand thinking ‚Üí Integrated learning experience"

Scenario 12: Student Provides Design for Feedback
