# Cognitive Enhancement Agent - Modular Architecture

The Cognitive Enhancement Agent has been refactored into a clean, modular structure while maintaining full backward compatibility with the original implementation.

## üìÅ Package Structure

```
cognitive_enhancement/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py           # Package initialization and exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapter.py            # Main adapter maintaining backward compatibility
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py             # Configuration constants and challenge templates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This documentation
```

## üéØ Core Functionality

The Cognitive Enhancement Agent provides:
- **Cognitive Offloading Prevention**: Detects and counters passive learning
- **Assumption Challenging**: Questions overconfident statements
- **Deep Thinking Promotion**: Encourages analytical reasoning
- **Metacognitive Development**: Builds self-awareness and reflection
- **Strategic Challenge Generation**: Creates context-appropriate cognitive challenges

## üîß Key Components

### Configuration (`config.py`)
- **Cognitive Thresholds**: Scoring boundaries for various cognitive states
- **Challenge Templates**: Pre-designed cognitive interventions
- **Enhancement Strategies**: Mapping cognitive states to interventions
- **Offloading Patterns**: Detection patterns for cognitive dependency
- **Scientific Metrics**: Research-based measurement configurations

### Challenge Types
- **Constraint Challenges**: Space, budget, time, material limitations
- **Perspective Challenges**: User groups, professionals, temporal shifts
- **Alternative Challenges**: Opposite approaches, different methods, scale changes
- **Metacognitive Challenges**: Assumption questioning, process reflection

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The original `CognitiveEnhancementAgent` class interface is preserved:

```python
from agents.cognitive_enhancement import CognitiveEnhancementAgent

# Original usage still works exactly the same
agent = CognitiveEnhancementAgent("architecture")
challenge = await agent.provide_challenge(state, context, analysis, routing)
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from agents.cognitive_enhancement import CognitiveEnhancementAgent

agent = CognitiveEnhancementAgent()
response = await agent.provide_challenge(state, context, analysis, routing)
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Access configuration directly
from agents.cognitive_enhancement.config import CHALLENGE_TEMPLATES, COGNITIVE_THRESHOLDS

# Use specific challenge types
constraint_challenges = CHALLENGE_TEMPLATES["constraint_challenges"]
```

## üß† Cognitive Science Foundation

### MIT Research Integration
Based on research in cognitive offloading and learning enhancement:
- **Active Learning Promotion**: Prevents passive information consumption
- **Desirable Difficulties**: Introduces productive cognitive challenges
- **Metacognitive Scaffolding**: Builds self-monitoring capabilities
- **Transfer Enhancement**: Improves knowledge application to new contexts

### Detection Patterns
- **Premature Answer Seeking**: Early requests for solutions
- **Superficial Confidence**: High confidence with low engagement
- **Passive Acceptance**: Minimal interaction and reflection
- **Repetitive Dependency**: Recurring requests for external validation

## üé® Challenge Strategies

### Constraint Challenges
Forces students to work within limitations:
- **Space Constraints**: "What if your site was half the size?"
- **Budget Limitations**: "How would you prioritize with 50% less budget?"
- **Time Pressure**: "What if construction time was halved?"
- **Material Restrictions**: "How would you adapt if steel wasn't available?"

### Perspective Shifts
Encourages viewing from different angles:
- **User Perspectives**: "How would a wheelchair user experience this?"
- **Professional Views**: "What would a structural engineer think?"
- **Temporal Changes**: "How will this design age over 20 years?"
- **Cultural Contexts**: "How would this work in a different culture?"

### Alternative Exploration
Pushes beyond first solutions:
- **Opposite Approaches**: "What if you designed for privacy instead of openness?"
- **Different Methods**: "How would you approach this from the inside out?"
- **Scale Variations**: "What if this was 10 times larger?"

### Metacognitive Prompts
Builds self-awareness:
- **Assumption Questioning**: "What assumptions are you making?"
- **Process Reflection**: "How did you arrive at this solution?"
- **Evidence Evaluation**: "What supports your design decisions?"

## üìä Scientific Metrics

### Cognitive Measurement
- **Offloading Prevention Score**: Measures independence building
- **Deep Thinking Engagement**: Assesses analytical reasoning
- **Knowledge Integration**: Evaluates concept connection
- **Scaffolding Effectiveness**: Measures support appropriateness

- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Assesses self-reflection

### Research Validation
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Against traditional tutoring methods
- **Improvement Tracking**: Longitudinal learning gains
- **Confidence Calibration**: Accuracy of self-assessment
- **Transfer Testing**: Application to new problems
