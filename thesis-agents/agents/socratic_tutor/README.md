# Socratic Tutor Agent - Modular Architecture

The Socratic Tutor Agent has been refactored into a clean, modular structure while maintaining full backward compatibility with the original implementation.

## üìÅ Package Structure

```
socratic_tutor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py           # Package initialization and exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapter.py            # Main adapter maintaining backward compatibility
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This documentation
```

## üéØ Core Functionality

The Socratic Tutor Agent provides:
- **Guided Questioning**: Generates thought-provoking questions to guide learning
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Creates questions specific to student's project and context
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Adjusts question difficulty to student understanding level
- **Discovery Learning**: Helps students discover insights rather than providing answers
- **Critical Thinking Development**: Promotes analytical and evaluative thinking

## üîß Key Components

### Socratic Method Implementation
- **Question Generation**: Context-aware question creation using LLM
- **Difficulty Adaptation**: Questions matched to student understanding level
- **Project Integration**: Questions tied to specific architectural projects
- **Learning Progression**: Questions that build on previous interactions

### Question Types
- **Clarifying Questions**: Help students articulate their thinking
- **Assumption-Challenging Questions**: Question underlying beliefs
- **Evidence Questions**: Ask for supporting reasoning
- **Perspective Questions**: Encourage viewing from different angles
- **Implication Questions**: Explore consequences of decisions

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The original `SocraticTutorAgent` class interface is preserved:

```python
from agents.socratic_tutor import SocraticTutorAgent

# Original usage still works exactly the same
agent = SocraticTutorAgent("architecture")
guidance = await agent.provide_guidance(state, context, analysis, gap_type)
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from agents.socratic_tutor import SocraticTutorAgent

agent = SocraticTutorAgent()
response = await agent.provide_guidance(state, context, analysis, gap_type)
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Direct question generation
question_result = await agent._generate_socratic_question(
    user_input, state, context, analysis, gap_type
)
```

## ü§î Socratic Method Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **No Direct Answers**: Guide students to discover insights themselves
